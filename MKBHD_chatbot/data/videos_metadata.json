They didn't pay for it.\nThey just kind of did it.\nSo shout-out to Tim.\nI guess in this case, it's totally fine.\nI guess there's just an\nelement of pride knowing\nthat, like, it's come a long\nway since the beginning.\nI remember like 6, 7, 8 years ago\nwhen there was zero YouTubers\nat any of these events,\nand then there was one\nand then there were three or four\nand then there were 12 or 13\nand just now we're all\njust a part of the media,\nindependent creators doing our thing.\nSo I feel like it's kind of a cool moment\nto see that come full circle.\nBut anyway, after that,\nthey just got right\ninto the announcements,\nthe flagship of which\nbeing the new iPhone.\nSo I made an entire separate\nvideo on the iPhones,\nmy first hands-on and impressions\nof all the little details\nand my first thoughts of everything.\nSo I'll link that below the Like button\nif you wanna check it\nout if you're interested.\nBut I'll just do a brief\nsummary here for you.\nSo the iPhone 15 gets the A16 Bionic chip\nfrom last year's iPhone Pro.\nIt gets the Dynamic Island, of\ncourse, from the Pro as well.\nSome new colors and a\nslightly updated design\nwith little better curve radiuses, radii,\na slightly nicer feel in the hand,\nand a satin soft-touch\nback and a slow USB-C port.\nSame starting price and\nscreen sizes as last year,\n799 for the iPhone 15\nand 899 for the iPhone 15 Plus.\nSo then the iPhone 15 Pro gets\na new three-nanometer A17 Pro chip.\nThere's these new brushed\nlighter titanium rails\nto replace the stainless steel,\na faster USB-C port,\na customizable action button on the side\nto replace the mute switch,\na new set of cameras,\nand just the 15 Pro Max gets\na new 5x telephoto camera.\nAnd the prices are kind of sneaky.\nSo it's still 999 for the 15 Pro\nbut the Pro Max now starts at 1,199\nbecause it's also starting at 256 gigs.\nThere's a lot more details\nand interesting stuff about the iPhone\nin that hands-on video,\nso you know where to find that.\nBut then there's the\nother stuff of this event.\nAlso, I thought it would\nbe cool to shoot here\nsince this is part\nof where they shot some\nscenes in the keynote,\nbut now I'm realizing\nthat it's a real place.\nThere's like chainsaws in the background.\nSo sorry about the noise.\nAnyway, we've got Apple\nWatch stuff, right?\nSo Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nAnd one of the most interesting things\nabout these new watches\nis that visually, just looking at them,\nthere's almost no way to actually tell\nthat you're looking at the new watch.\nIt's very unlike Apple.\nSo I think there's a new\npink color with the Series 9,\nbut other than that, it looks\nidentical to the Series 8\nand the Ultra 2 looks\nidentical to the Ultra.\nBut instead, under the hood,\nthere's a big process update\nto this new S9 system on a chip,\nwhich is more powerful and more efficient,\nand that's allowing\nthem to push the watches\nto a higher max brightness\nwhile keeping the same\nquoted battery life.\nSo the Series 9 is gonna get\nup to 2,000 nits max brightness now\nand the Ultra 2 is up to 3,000 nits,\nwhich is actually now, it's\nthe brightest display ever\non any Apple product.\nAnd they've also moved all\nSiri requests on the watch now\nto stay on device\ninstead of always having to do\na round trip to the internet,\nwhich I think could help,\n'cause there's a lot of instances of Siri\nwhere you, like, ask it,\n\"What's the time in Cupertino?\"\nAnd it goes, \"Hold on a second.\nWait for it. I'm thinking about it.\nI don't know yet,\"\nand it's just frustrating\nand it doesn't work.\nSo that should be faster\nand more efficient.\nIt doesn't mean Siri's gonna be good.\nIt just means it'll be bad but faster.\nBut then there's also a\nnew Ultra Wideband chip\nthat can talk to the iPhones\nto make Find My iPhone way more precise\nand actually point out a direction\nto help you find your phone\ninstead of just playing a sound.\nI think that's gonna be super\nuseful for a lot of people.\nBut the most sneaky, interesting\nupdate here to the watch\nis this new double tap gesture.\nSo, so, okay, you've got the new watch on\nand, basically, it's always able to detect\nif you do this double tap\nof your thumb and your\nindex finger together.\nAnd so I got to try it a\nbunch of times at the event\nwith a demo watch in the hands-on area.\nIt actually seemed very accurate.\nLike, you basically, you raise it to wake,\ngive it a split second,\nand then double tap to\npress the primary button\nof whatever app you're in\nthat's on your screen at the moment.\nSo it can accept or reject\nan incoming phone call\nor stop a timer\nor scroll through the\nSmart Stack of widgets\non the watch face.\nAnd yeah, it was working really\nwell for me very quickly.\nThis would clearly be super\nhelpful if my other hand is busy\nor I'm holding something\nor I just wanna quickly do something.\nOrdinarily, honestly, I\nwould be trying to do that\nwith my nose.\nSo this is much better.\nNow, the reason I say this is sneaky\nis because I don't know if you remember,\njust a few weeks ago or months ago,\nthis is the same gesture\nused to select things\nwhile you're wearing Apple Vision Pro.\nIn the VR headset, selecting\nthings is like this.\nAnd so now on the watch,\nselecting things is like that.\nNow, some of you have already\npointed out on Twitter\nthis isn't exactly new completely.\nIf you've ever dug through\nthe accessibility settings\non the Apple Watch before,\nyou've probably found by\na slightly different name\nbasically the exact same feature\nand you've been able to double tap\nand do all kinds of other things.\nNow, why isn't this new double tap\nto select primary stuff feature\ncoming to other Apple watches,\nyou might be asking.\nApple says that basically this\nnew S9 chip is much faster\nat processing all the info\nfrom all those sensors\nand so you'll be able\nto do it more readily.\nAnd so that's why it's only coming\nto the new S9-powered Apple watches.\nIt's convenient.\nBut let's talk about AirPods real quick\nbecause this might actually\nbe the ultimate sneaky update.\nSo the fact is these\nbarely even got mentioned\nduring the keynote, right?\nLike, they just casually dropped\nthat there would be a new USB-C\ncase for the AirPods Pro 2\nin, like, one fleeting slide\nand that was basically it.\nSo you could be led to believe\nthat there's just nothing new\nwith the AirPods themselves\nand they're exactly the same.\nBut you'd be wrong.\nSo basically, for all\nintents and purposes,\nAirPods Pro 2 with the wireless\ncharging Lightning case\nand AirPods Pro 2 with the\nwireless charging USB-C case\nare the same product with a different port\nunless you have Apple Vision Pro,\nin which case, the USB-C\nversion will be capable\nof doing lossless audio with low latency\nwith this new codec\nthat Apple has created\njust for this purpose,\nthis awesome immersive experience.\nSo if you don't have Apple Vision Pro,\nthen they're basically the same product\nwith two different ports,\nbut there is actually new\nhardware and new architecture\nto make this feature possible\nwith the new USB-C version.\nI don't think they wanna\ntalk about that too much\nto not make people who\njust bought them last week\nfeel too bad about it,\nbut they're actually different headphones.\nSo that's a sneaky update right there\nfrom Apple behind the scenes\non one of their most popular products.\nBut that's a good transition\njust to get to the last\nseemingly big pillar\nof this announcement,\nwhich was carbon neutrality\nand the environment.\nSo Apple couldn't stop\ntalking about the environment\nthroughout this keynote,\nincluding one huge overly\nself-congratulatory,\nlike, 10-minute skit\nin the middle of the keynote video\nwith Tim Cook and Apple employees\ntalking to Mother Nature\nabout how much progress they've made\nwith their products environmentally.\nI just basically want to\ndig more into this later.\nI would say I'm not an expert on this,\nso there's no way that I\ncan fully appreciate now\nand fully understand now\neverything that was said.\nThere's a lot of specific language used.\nSome of it is very clear,\nlike just straight up not\nusing any leather anymore\nin any Apple products,\nusing recycled materials\ninstead of new virgin materials,\nthings like that,\nhaving more sustainable energy sources.\nBut then there's other things that they,\nI mean, there was a lot.\nThere was a lot going on\nand some of it is not quite as simple.\nBut they have clearly made\na lot of progress and change\nand they eventually landed on this moment\nwhere they were like, \"The\nApple Watch is the first\nfully carbon neutral product\nthat Apple's actually shipping,\"\non their way to ideally\nbeing fully carbon neutral\nas a company by 2030.\nAnd so there's a lot of progress\nthat they still need to make.\nAnd as much as we've talked\nabout how much Apple still needs to do,\nI kind of feel like I\ncan't get mad at this.\nLike, you know what it feels like,\nyou ever see those like YouTube videos\nwhere a YouTuber on the\nstreet, they'll be micd up\nand they'll, like, give a homeless person\na hundred bucks or something\nand half the comments\nare like, \"Oh, come on,\nyou clearly didn't have\nto do it on camera.\nLike, if you really cared,\nthen you would do it not on camera.\"\nAnd that's probably all mostly true,\nbut also, that person in need\nstill did just get a hundred bucks.\nSo it's like some net\npositive was still done.\nAnd this kind of feels the same way to me.\nLike, okay, Apple is actually\ndoing a bunch of stuff\nto use recycled materials\nand to make less of an\nimpact on the environment\nand then they're doing a\nbig song and dance about it\nso everyone can see it,\nso that everyone sees it.\nAnd so you'd say, \"Okay,\nif they really cared,\nthey would do a whole bunch more stuff.\"\nAnd that's still true,\nbut I can't get mad at the improvements\nthat they are actually making.\nHopefully that makes sense.\nEither way, like I\nsaid, I'm not an expert.\nI wanna dig more into this.\nI wanna talk to some people\nwho actually are experts\non it who can help me out\nand maybe that's a future\ntopic for another video.\nBut that's just my thoughts and reactions\nfrom the Wonderlust event of 2023.\nLet me know what your thoughts are below.\nThere's a lot to talk about\nand a lot of random, sneaky stuff\nand the comments section is\nalways open to talk about it.\nAnd techtember rolls on.\nSo stick with us.\nSubscribe if you haven't already.\nThanks for watching.\nCatch you guys later. Peace.\n(upbeat music)\n", "punctuated_text": "- All right. so Apple's Wonderlust event happened. It was pretty interesting. Honestly, not that much stuff actually got announced. I mean, we knew it was gonna be iPhone, Apple Watch, USB-C, not that much other stuff, But it was more the stuff in between the lines that was kind of interesting and some other random stuff that I don't think a lot of people are talking about. So let's talk about it Now. first of all, I gotta say it was a complete surprise to me when one of the first things that they did was quote my MacBook Air review. So you know, like the beginning of the keynotes they usually do, where they sort of recap a bunch of stuff that's previously happened. One of the things they did was talk about the MacBook Air and this happened - And Marques Brownlee said: \"The 15-inch MacBook Air is going to instantly rocket to the top of the lineup to become the most popular 15-inch laptop\". We love the new MacBook Air and the entire Mac lineup - And that was pretty cool. I gotta say. they didn't tell me they were gonna do that, They didn't ask, They didn't pay for it, They just kind of did it. So shout-out to Tim. I guess in this case it's totally fine. I guess there's just an element of pride knowing that like it's come a long way since the beginning. I remember like 6,, 7,, 8 years ago when there was zero YouTubers at any of these events and then there was one, and then there were three or four, and then there were 12 or 13, and just now we're all just a part of the media, independent creators, doing our thing. So I feel like it's kind of a cool moment to see that come full circle. But anyway, after that they just got right into the announcements, the flagship of which being the new iPhone. So I made an entire separate video on the iPhones, my first hands-on and impressions of all the little details and my first thoughts of everything. So I'll link that below the Like button if you wanna check it out, if you're interested. But I'll just do a brief summary here for you. So the iPhone 15 gets the A16 Bionic chip from last year's iPhone Pro. It gets the Dynamic Island, of course, from the Pro as well, Some new colors and a slightly updated design with little better curve, radiuses, radii, a slightly nicer feel in the hand and a satin soft-touch back and a slow USB-C port. Same starting price and screen sizes as last year: 799 for the iPhone 15 and 899 for the iPhone 15 Plus. So then the iPhone 15 Pro gets a new three-nanometer A17 Pro chip, There's these new brushed, lighter titanium rails to replace the stainless steel, a faster USB-C port, a customizable action button on the side to replace the mute switch, a new set of cameras and just the 15 Pro Max gets a new 5x telephoto camera, And the prices are kind of sneaky. So it's still 999 for the 15 Pro, but the Pro Max now starts at 1,199 because it's also starting at 256 gigs. There's a lot more details and interesting stuff about the iPhone in that hands-on video, so you know where to find that. But then there's the other stuff of this event. Also, I thought it would be cool to shoot here, since this is part of where they shot some scenes in the keynote, but now I'm realizing that it's a real place. There's like chainsaws in the background, So sorry about the noise. Anyway, we've got Apple Watch stuff right. So Series 9 and Ultra 2.. And one of the most interesting things about these new watches is that visually, just looking at them, there's almost no way to actually tell that you're looking at the new watch. It's very unlike Apple. So I think there's a new pink color with the Series 9, but other than that it looks identical to the Series 8 and the Ultra 2 looks identical to the Ultra, But instead, under the hood there's a big process update to this new S9 system on a chip which is more powerful and more efficient, and that's allowing them to push the watches to a higher max brightness while keeping the same quoted battery life. So the Series 9 is gonna get up to 2,000 nits max brightness now and the Ultra 2 is up to 3,000 nits, which is actually now it's- the brightest display ever on any Apple product. And they've also moved all Siri requests on the watch now to stay on device instead of always having to do a round trip to the internet, which I think could help, 'cause there's a lot of instances of Siri where you like ask it \"What's the time in Cupertino\" And it goes: \"Hold on a second, Wait for it. I'm thinking about it, I don't know yet\". and it's just frustrating and it doesn't work. So that should be faster and more efficient. It doesn't mean Siri's gonna be good, It just means it'll be bad, but faster. But then there's also a new Ultra Wideband chip that can talk to the iPhones to make Find My iPhone way more precise and actually point out a direction to help you find your phone instead of just playing a sound. I think that's gonna be super useful for a lot of people. But the most sneaky, interesting update here to the watch is this new double tap gesture. So so, okay, you've got the new watch on and basically it's always able to detect if you do this double tap of your thumb and your index finger together, And so I got to try it a bunch of times at the event with a demo watch in the hands-on area. It actually seemed very accurate, Like you. basically you raise it to wake, give it a split second and then double tap to press the primary button of whatever app you're in that's on your screen at the moment, So it can accept or reject an incoming phone call or stop a timer or scroll through the Smart Stack of widgets on the watch face. And yeah, it was working really well for me. very quickly. This would clearly be super helpful if my other hand is busy or I'm holding something or I just wanna quickly do something. Ordinarily, honestly, I would be trying to do that with my nose, So this is much better Now. the reason I say this is sneaky is because I don't know if you remember, just a few weeks ago or months ago, this is the same gesture used to select things. while you're wearing Apple Vision Pro In the VR headset, selecting things is like this. And so now, on the watch, selecting things is like that. Now, some of you have already pointed out on Twitter, this isn't exactly new completely. If you've ever dug through the accessibility settings on the Apple Watch before, you've probably found, by a slightly different name, basically the exact same feature, and you've been able to double tap and do all kinds of other things. Now why isn't this new double tap to select primary stuff feature coming to other Apple watches, you might be asking? Apple says that, basically, this new S9 chip is much faster at processing all the info from all those sensors and so you'll be able to do it more readily, And so that's why it's only coming to the new S9-powered Apple watches. It's convenient. But let's talk about AirPods real quick, because this might actually be the ultimate sneaky update. So the fact is these barely even got mentioned during the keynote, right Like they just casually dropped that there would be a new USB-C case for the AirPods Pro 2 in like one fleeting slide and that was basically it. So you could be led to believe that there's just nothing new with the AirPods themselves, and they're exactly the same, But you'd be wrong. So basically, for all intents and purposes, AirPods Pro 2 with the wireless charging Lightning case and AirPods Pro 2 with the wireless charging USB-C case are the same product with a different port, unless you have Apple Vision Pro, in which case the USB-C version will be capable of doing lossless audio with low latency with this new codec that Apple has created just for this purpose, this awesome immersive experience. So if you don't have Apple Vision Pro, then they're basically the same product with two different ports, but there is actually new hardware and new architecture to make this feature possible with the new USB-C version. I don't think they wanna talk about that too much to not make people who just bought them last week feel too bad about it, but they're actually different headphones. So that's a sneaky update right there from Apple behind the scenes on one of their most popular products, But that's a good transition. just to get to the last seemingly big pillar of this announcement, which was carbon neutrality and the environment. So Apple couldn't stop talking about the environment throughout this keynote, including one huge, overly self-congratulatory, like 10-minute skit in the middle of the keynote video with Tim Cook and Apple employees talking to Mother Nature about how much progress they've made with their products environmentally. I just basically want to dig more into this later. I would say I'm not an expert on this, so there's no way that I can fully appreciate now and fully understand now everything that was said. There's a lot of specific language used. Some of it is very clear- like, just straight up, not using any leather anymore in any Apple products, using recycled materials instead of new virgin materials, things like that, having more sustainable energy sources. But then there's other things that they- I mean there was a lot. There was a lot going on, and some of it is not quite as simple, But they have clearly made a lot of progress and change and they eventually landed on this moment where they were like: \"The Apple Watch is the first fully carbon neutral product that Apple's actually shipping\", on their way to ideally being fully carbon neutral as a company by 2030. And so there's a lot of progress that they still need to make, And as much as we've talked about how much Apple still needs to do, I kind of feel like I can't get mad at this. Like you know what it feels like. you ever see those like YouTube videos where a YouTuber on the street, they'll be micd up and they'll like give a homeless person a hundred bucks or something, and half the comments are like \"Oh, come on, you clearly didn't have to do it on camera. Like, if you really cared, then you would do it not on camera\". And that's probably all mostly true. but also that person in need still did just get a hundred bucks. So it's like some net positive was still done. And this kind of feels the same way to me. Like, okay, Apple is actually doing a bunch of stuff to use recycled materials and to make less of an impact on the environment, and then they're doing a big song and dance about it so everyone can see it, so that everyone sees it. And so you'd say \"Okay, if they really cared, they would do a whole bunch more stuff\". And that's still true, but I can't get mad at the improvements that they are actually making. Hopefully that makes sense. Either way, like I said, I'm not an expert. I wanna dig more into this. I wanna talk to some people who actually are experts on it who can help me out, and maybe that's a future topic for another video, But that's just my thoughts and reactions from the Wonderlust event of 2023.. Let me know what your thoughts are below. There's a lot to talk about and a lot of random sneaky stuff, and the comments section is always open to talk about it. And techtember rolls on, So stick with us. Subscribe if you haven't already. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys later.

They didn't pay for it.\nThey just kind of did it.\nSo shout-out to Tim.\nI guess in this case, it's totally fine.\nI guess there's just an\nelement of pride knowing\nthat, like, it's come a long\nway since the beginning.\nI remember like 6, 7, 8 years ago\nwhen there was zero YouTubers\nat any of these events,\nand then there was one\nand then there were three or four\nand then there were 12 or 13\nand just now we're all\njust a part of the media,\nindependent creators doing our thing.\nSo I feel like it's kind of a cool moment\nto see that come full circle.\nBut anyway, after that,\nthey just got right\ninto the announcements,\nthe flagship of which\nbeing the new iPhone.\nSo I made an entire separate\nvideo on the iPhones,\nmy first hands-on and impressions\nof all the little details\nand my first thoughts of everything.\nSo I'll link that below the Like button\nif you wanna check it\nout if you're interested.\nBut I'll just do a brief\nsummary here for you.\nSo the iPhone 15 gets the A16 Bionic chip\nfrom last year's iPhone Pro.\nIt gets the Dynamic Island, of\ncourse, from the Pro as well.\nSome new colors and a\nslightly updated design\nwith little better curve radiuses, radii,\na slightly nicer feel in the hand,\nand a satin soft-touch\nback and a slow USB-C port.\nSame starting price and\nscreen sizes as last year,\n799 for the iPhone 15\nand 899 for the iPhone 15 Plus.\nSo then the iPhone 15 Pro gets\na new three-nanometer A17 Pro chip.\nThere's these new brushed\nlighter titanium rails\nto replace the stainless steel,\na faster USB-C port,\na customizable action button on the side\nto replace the mute switch,\na new set of cameras,\nand just the 15 Pro Max gets\na new 5x telephoto camera.\nAnd the prices are kind of sneaky.\nSo it's still 999 for the 15 Pro\nbut the Pro Max now starts at 1,199\nbecause it's also starting at 256 gigs.\nThere's a lot more details\nand interesting stuff about the iPhone\nin that hands-on video,\nso you know where to find that.\nBut then there's the\nother stuff of this event.\nAlso, I thought it would\nbe cool to shoot here\nsince this is part\nof where they shot some\nscenes in the keynote,\nbut now I'm realizing\nthat it's a real place.\nThere's like chainsaws in the background.\nSo sorry about the noise.\nAnyway, we've got Apple\nWatch stuff, right?\nSo Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nAnd one of the most interesting things\nabout these new watches\nis that visually, just looking at them,\nthere's almost no way to actually tell\nthat you're looking at the new watch.\nIt's very unlike Apple.\nSo I think there's a new\npink color with the Series 9,\nbut other than that, it looks\nidentical to the Series 8\nand the Ultra 2 looks\nidentical to the Ultra.\nBut instead, under the hood,\nthere's a big process update\nto this new S9 system on a chip,\nwhich is more powerful and more efficient,\nand that's allowing\nthem to push the watches\nto a higher max brightness\nwhile keeping the same\nquoted battery life.\nSo the Series 9 is gonna get\nup to 2,000 nits max brightness now\nand the Ultra 2 is up to 3,000 nits,\nwhich is actually now, it's\nthe brightest display ever\non any Apple product.\nAnd they've also moved all\nSiri requests on the watch now\nto stay on device\ninstead of always having to do\na round trip to the internet,\nwhich I think could help,\n'cause there's a lot of instances of Siri\nwhere you, like, ask it,\n\"What's the time in Cupertino?\"\nAnd it goes, \"Hold on a second.\nWait for it. I'm thinking about it.\nI don't know yet,\"\nand it's just frustrating\nand it doesn't work.\nSo that should be faster\nand more efficient.\nIt doesn't mean Siri's gonna be good.\nIt just means it'll be bad but faster.\nBut then there's also a\nnew Ultra Wideband chip\nthat can talk to the iPhones\nto make Find My iPhone way more precise\nand actually point out a direction\nto help you find your phone\ninstead of just playing a sound.\nI think that's gonna be super\nuseful for a lot of people.\nBut the most sneaky, interesting\nupdate here to the watch\nis this new double tap gesture.\nSo, so, okay, you've got the new watch on\nand, basically, it's always able to detect\nif you do this double tap\nof your thumb and your\nindex finger together.\nAnd so I got to try it a\nbunch of times at the event\nwith a demo watch in the hands-on area.\nIt actually seemed very accurate.\nLike, you basically, you raise it to wake,\ngive it a split second,\nand then double tap to\npress the primary button\nof whatever app you're in\nthat's on your screen at the moment.\nSo it can accept or reject\nan incoming phone call\nor stop a timer\nor scroll through the\nSmart Stack of widgets\non the watch face.\nAnd yeah, it was working really\nwell for me very quickly.\nThis would clearly be super\nhelpful if my other hand is busy\nor I'm holding something\nor I just wanna quickly do something.\nOrdinarily, honestly, I\nwould be trying to do that\nwith my nose.\nSo this is much better.\nNow, the reason I say this is sneaky\nis because I don't know if you remember,\njust a few weeks ago or months ago,\nthis is the same gesture\nused to select things\nwhile you're wearing Apple Vision Pro.\nIn the VR headset, selecting\nthings is like this.\nAnd so now on the watch,\nselecting things is like that.\nNow, some of you have already\npointed out on Twitter\nthis isn't exactly new completely.\nIf you've ever dug through\nthe accessibility settings\non the Apple Watch before,\nyou've probably found by\na slightly different name\nbasically the exact same feature\nand you've been able to double tap\nand do all kinds of other things.\nNow, why isn't this new double tap\nto select primary stuff feature\ncoming to other Apple watches,\nyou might be asking.\nApple says that basically this\nnew S9 chip is much faster\nat processing all the info\nfrom all those sensors\nand so you'll be able\nto do it more readily.\nAnd so that's why it's only coming\nto the new S9-powered Apple watches.\nIt's convenient.\nBut let's talk about AirPods real quick\nbecause this might actually\nbe the ultimate sneaky update.\nSo the fact is these\nbarely even got mentioned\nduring the keynote, right?\nLike, they just casually dropped\nthat there would be a new USB-C\ncase for the AirPods Pro 2\nin, like, one fleeting slide\nand that was basically it.\nSo you could be led to believe\nthat there's just nothing new\nwith the AirPods themselves\nand they're exactly the same.\nBut you'd be wrong.\nSo basically, for all\nintents and purposes,\nAirPods Pro 2 with the wireless\ncharging Lightning case\nand AirPods Pro 2 with the\nwireless charging USB-C case\nare the same product with a different port\nunless you have Apple Vision Pro,\nin which case, the USB-C\nversion will be capable\nof doing lossless audio with low latency\nwith this new codec\nthat Apple has created\njust for this purpose,\nthis awesome immersive experience.\nSo if you don't have Apple Vision Pro,\nthen they're basically the same product\nwith two different ports,\nbut there is actually new\nhardware and new architecture\nto make this feature possible\nwith the new USB-C version.\nI don't think they wanna\ntalk about that too much\nto not make people who\njust bought them last week\nfeel too bad about it,\nbut they're actually different headphones.\nSo that's a sneaky update right there\nfrom Apple behind the scenes\non one of their most popular products.\nBut that's a good transition\njust to get to the last\nseemingly big pillar\nof this announcement,\nwhich was carbon neutrality\nand the environment.\nSo Apple couldn't stop\ntalking about the environment\nthroughout this keynote,\nincluding one huge overly\nself-congratulatory,\nlike, 10-minute skit\nin the middle of the keynote video\nwith Tim Cook and Apple employees\ntalking to Mother Nature\nabout how much progress they've made\nwith their products environmentally.\nI just basically want to\ndig more into this later.\nI would say I'm not an expert on this,\nso there's no way that I\ncan fully appreciate now\nand fully understand now\neverything that was said.\nThere's a lot of specific language used.\nSome of it is very clear,\nlike just straight up not\nusing any leather anymore\nin any Apple products,\nusing recycled materials\ninstead of new virgin materials,\nthings like that,\nhaving more sustainable energy sources.\nBut then there's other things that they,\nI mean, there was a lot.\nThere was a lot going on\nand some of it is not quite as simple.\nBut they have clearly made\na lot of progress and change\nand they eventually landed on this moment\nwhere they were like, \"The\nApple Watch is the first\nfully carbon neutral product\nthat Apple's actually shipping,\"\non their way to ideally\nbeing fully carbon neutral\nas a company by 2030.\nAnd so there's a lot of progress\nthat they still need to make.\nAnd as much as we've talked\nabout how much Apple still needs to do,\nI kind of feel like I\ncan't get mad at this.\nLike, you know what it feels like,\nyou ever see those like YouTube videos\nwhere a YouTuber on the\nstreet, they'll be micd up\nand they'll, like, give a homeless person\na hundred bucks or something\nand half the comments\nare like, \"Oh, come on,\nyou clearly didn't have\nto do it on camera.\nLike, if you really cared,\nthen you would do it not on camera.\"\nAnd that's probably all mostly true,\nbut also, that person in need\nstill did just get a hundred bucks.\nSo it's like some net\npositive was still done.\nAnd this kind of feels the same way to me.\nLike, okay, Apple is actually\ndoing a bunch of stuff\nto use recycled materials\nand to make less of an\nimpact on the environment\nand then they're doing a\nbig song and dance about it\nso everyone can see it,\nso that everyone sees it.\nAnd so you'd say, \"Okay,\nif they really cared,\nthey would do a whole bunch more stuff.\"\nAnd that's still true,\nbut I can't get mad at the improvements\nthat they are actually making.\nHopefully that makes sense.\nEither way, like I\nsaid, I'm not an expert.\nI wanna dig more into this.\nI wanna talk to some people\nwho actually are experts\non it who can help me out\nand maybe that's a future\ntopic for another video.\nBut that's just my thoughts and reactions\nfrom the Wonderlust event of 2023.\nLet me know what your thoughts are below.\nThere's a lot to talk about\nand a lot of random, sneaky stuff\nand the comments section is\nalways open to talk about it.\nAnd techtember rolls on.\nSo stick with us.\nSubscribe if you haven't already.\nThanks for watching.\nCatch you guys later. Peace.\n(upbeat music)\n", "punctuated_text": "- All right. so Apple's Wonderlust event happened. It was pretty interesting. Honestly, not that much stuff actually got announced. I mean, we knew it was gonna be iPhone, Apple Watch, USB-C, not that much other stuff, But it was more the stuff in between the lines that was kind of interesting and some other random stuff that I don't think a lot of people are talking about. So let's talk about it Now. first of all, I gotta say it was a complete surprise to me when one of the first things that they did was quote my MacBook Air review. So you know, like the beginning of the keynotes they usually do, where they sort of recap a bunch of stuff that's previously happened. One of the things they did was talk about the MacBook Air and this happened - And Marques Brownlee said: \"The 15-inch MacBook Air is going to instantly rocket to the top of the lineup to become the most popular 15-inch laptop\". We love the new MacBook Air and the entire Mac lineup - And that was pretty cool. I gotta say. they didn't tell me they were gonna do that, They didn't ask, They didn't pay for it, They just kind of did it. So shout-out to Tim. I guess in this case it's totally fine. I guess there's just an element of pride knowing that like it's come a long way since the beginning. I remember like 6,, 7,, 8 years ago when there was zero YouTubers at any of these events and then there was one, and then there were three or four, and then there were 12 or 13, and just now we're all just a part of the media, independent creators, doing our thing. So I feel like it's kind of a cool moment to see that come full circle. But anyway, after that they just got right into the announcements, the flagship of which being the new iPhone. So I made an entire separate video on the iPhones, my first hands-on and impressions of all the little details and my first thoughts of everything. So I'll link that below the Like button if you wanna check it out, if you're interested. But I'll just do a brief summary here for you. So the iPhone 15 gets the A16 Bionic chip from last year's iPhone Pro. It gets the Dynamic Island, of course, from the Pro as well, Some new colors and a slightly updated design with little better curve, radiuses, radii, a slightly nicer feel in the hand and a satin soft-touch back and a slow USB-C port. Same starting price and screen sizes as last year: 799 for the iPhone 15 and 899 for the iPhone 15 Plus. So then the iPhone 15 Pro gets a new three-nanometer A17 Pro chip, There's these new brushed, lighter titanium rails to replace the stainless steel, a faster USB-C port, a customizable action button on the side to replace the mute switch, a new set of cameras and just the 15 Pro Max gets a new 5x telephoto camera, And the prices are kind of sneaky. So it's still 999 for the 15 Pro, but the Pro Max now starts at 1,199 because it's also starting at 256 gigs. There's a lot more details and interesting stuff about the iPhone in that hands-on video, so you know where to find that. But then there's the other stuff of this event. Also, I thought it would be cool to shoot here, since this is part of where they shot some scenes in the keynote, but now I'm realizing that it's a real place. There's like chainsaws in the background, So sorry about the noise. Anyway, we've got Apple Watch stuff right. So Series 9 and Ultra 2.. And one of the most interesting things about these new watches is that visually, just looking at them, there's almost no way to actually tell that you're looking at the new watch. It's very unlike Apple. So I think there's a new pink color with the Series 9, but other than that it looks identical to the Series 8 and the Ultra 2 looks identical to the Ultra, But instead, under the hood there's a big process update to this new S9 system on a chip which is more powerful and more efficient, and that's allowing them to push the watches to a higher max brightness while keeping the same quoted battery life. So the Series 9 is gonna get up to 2,000 nits max brightness now and the Ultra 2 is up to 3,000 nits, which is actually now it's- the brightest display ever on any Apple product. And they've also moved all Siri requests on the watch now to stay on device instead of always having to do a round trip to the internet, which I think could help, 'cause there's a lot of instances of Siri where you like ask it \"What's the time in Cupertino\" And it goes: \"Hold on a second, Wait for it. I'm thinking about it, I don't know yet\". and it's just frustrating and it doesn't work. So that should be faster and more efficient. It doesn't mean Siri's gonna be good, It just means it'll be bad, but faster. But then there's also a new Ultra Wideband chip that can talk to the iPhones to make Find My iPhone way more precise and actually point out a direction to help you find your phone instead of just playing a sound. I think that's gonna be super useful for a lot of people. But the most sneaky, interesting update here to the watch is this new double tap gesture. So so, okay, you've got the new watch on and basically it's always able to detect if you do this double tap of your thumb and your index finger together, And so I got to try it a bunch of times at the event with a demo watch in the hands-on area. It actually seemed very accurate, Like you. basically you raise it to wake, give it a split second and then double tap to press the primary button of whatever app you're in that's on your screen at the moment, So it can accept or reject an incoming phone call or stop a timer or scroll through the Smart Stack of widgets on the watch face. And yeah, it was working really well for me. very quickly. This would clearly be super helpful if my other hand is busy or I'm holding something or I just wanna quickly do something. Ordinarily, honestly, I would be trying to do that with my nose, So this is much better Now. the reason I say this is sneaky is because I don't know if you remember, just a few weeks ago or months ago, this is the same gesture used to select things. while you're wearing Apple Vision Pro In the VR headset, selecting things is like this. And so now, on the watch, selecting things is like that. Now, some of you have already pointed out on Twitter, this isn't exactly new completely. If you've ever dug through the accessibility settings on the Apple Watch before, you've probably found, by a slightly different name, basically the exact same feature, and you've been able to double tap and do all kinds of other things. Now why isn't this new double tap to select primary stuff feature coming to other Apple watches, you might be asking? Apple says that, basically, this new S9 chip is much faster at processing all the info from all those sensors and so you'll be able to do it more readily, And so that's why it's only coming to the new S9-powered Apple watches. It's convenient. But let's talk about AirPods real quick, because this might actually be the ultimate sneaky update. So the fact is these barely even got mentioned during the keynote, right Like they just casually dropped that there would be a new USB-C case for the AirPods Pro 2 in like one fleeting slide and that was basically it. So you could be led to believe that there's just nothing new with the AirPods themselves, and they're exactly the same, But you'd be wrong. So basically, for all intents and purposes, AirPods Pro 2 with the wireless charging Lightning case and AirPods Pro 2 with the wireless charging USB-C case are the same product with a different port, unless you have Apple Vision Pro, in which case the USB-C version will be capable of doing lossless audio with low latency with this new codec that Apple has created just for this purpose, this awesome immersive experience. So if you don't have Apple Vision Pro, then they're basically the same product with two different ports, but there is actually new hardware and new architecture to make this feature possible with the new USB-C version. I don't think they wanna talk about that too much to not make people who just bought them last week feel too bad about it, but they're actually different headphones. So that's a sneaky update right there from Apple behind the scenes on one of their most popular products, But that's a good transition. just to get to the last seemingly big pillar of this announcement, which was carbon neutrality and the environment. So Apple couldn't stop talking about the environment throughout this keynote, including one huge, overly self-congratulatory, like 10-minute skit in the middle of the keynote video with Tim Cook and Apple employees talking to Mother Nature about how much progress they've made with their products environmentally. I just basically want to dig more into this later. I would say I'm not an expert on this, so there's no way that I can fully appreciate now and fully understand now everything that was said. There's a lot of specific language used. Some of it is very clear- like, just straight up, not using any leather anymore in any Apple products, using recycled materials instead of new virgin materials, things like that, having more sustainable energy sources. But then there's other things that they- I mean there was a lot. There was a lot going on, and some of it is not quite as simple, But they have clearly made a lot of progress and change and they eventually landed on this moment where they were like: \"The Apple Watch is the first fully carbon neutral product that Apple's actually shipping\", on their way to ideally being fully carbon neutral as a company by 2030. And so there's a lot of progress that they still need to make, And as much as we've talked about how much Apple still needs to do, I kind of feel like I can't get mad at this. Like you know what it feels like. you ever see those like YouTube videos where a YouTuber on the street, they'll be micd up and they'll like give a homeless person a hundred bucks or something, and half the comments are like \"Oh, come on, you clearly didn't have to do it on camera. Like, if you really cared, then you would do it not on camera\". And that's probably all mostly true. but also that person in need still did just get a hundred bucks. So it's like some net positive was still done. And this kind of feels the same way to me. Like, okay, Apple is actually doing a bunch of stuff to use recycled materials and to make less of an impact on the environment, and then they're doing a big song and dance about it so everyone can see it, so that everyone sees it. And so you'd say \"Okay, if they really cared, they would do a whole bunch more stuff\". And that's still true, but I can't get mad at the improvements that they are actually making. Hopefully that makes sense. Either way, like I said, I'm not an expert. I wanna dig more into this. I wanna talk to some people who actually are experts on it who can help me out, and maybe that's a future topic for another video, But that's just my thoughts and reactions from the Wonderlust event of 2023.. Let me know what your thoughts are below. There's a lot to talk about and a lot of random sneaky stuff, and the comments section is always open to talk about it.

right, so this is a crypto phone.\nAnd I know what you're thinking,\n\"What the hell is a crypto phone,\nand why would anyone want that?\"\nAnd that's exactly what I was thinking\nwhen this first crossed my radar.\nSo this is an upper,\nmid-range Android phone,\nwith crazy material choices,\nfrom a brand you've never heard of,\nwith some specific\ncrypto features built in,\nthat launched at a thousand dollars.\nNow, I know I have been notably skeptical\non crypto and Web3 and\nblockchain and the Metaverse\nand all that sort of stuff\nover the past couple years,\nso you may consider me biased,\nbut I still think if you took\nthe crypto out of this phone,\nit would at least have potential.\nI'm serious.\nLet me explain.\nSo the story of this phone\nactually starts all the way back\nwith the Essential Phone.\nSo I don't know how many y'all remember\nthe Essential Phone back in 2017,\nbut that was a really interesting\nand exciting new development\nin the smartphone world.\nWe don't get that many\ngenuinely promising,\nnew phone companies coming\nalong and doing good things,\nbut that's exactly what\nthis Andy Rubin startup\nwas promising when they came\nout with their first phone.\nIt was just this refreshing\nsort of minimal design.\nThere were no protruding camera bumps,\nno big logos or branding.\nThey were one of the first\nto do this camera notch here,\nat the top of the screen,\nwith the thin bezels,\nand they were one of the only ones\nusing these super premium materials,\nthe titanium rails and\npolished ceramic on the back,\nand then it just had some pins on the back\nwith some magnets for attaching\nsome modular accessories,\njust some genuinely\ninteresting, really cool ideas\non top of some super clean software.\nNow, unfortunately, this\nexperiment didn't really catch on.\nYou know, this unfortunate\ncombination of high price,\nmediocre cameras, not that\nstrong of a feature set\nfor regular people to care,\nlaunching as a Sprint exclusive,\nall of this led to extremely low sales.\nAnd then the company would\ngo on to dynamite itself\nafter a bunch of info\nabout Andy Rubin comes out.\nAnd so we would not get\nto see a second try,\nan Essential Phone 2.\nNow, it sucks to see a promising company\nwith a ton of talent\njust disappear like that,\nbut something that happens a lot,\na lot of times when these\nbusinesses dissolve,\nis the teams that worked on stuff\nsometimes will pop up somewhere else,\nand work on something else.\nAnd so sure enough, in 2020,\na bunch of the engineers from\nthe original Essential team\ngot back together to form\na new company, called OSOM,\nand they would announce their\nfirst project, the OSOM OV1,\nbasically the spiritual\nsuccessor to the Essential Phone,\nand you can see a lot of\nsimilarities and continuity\nin this announcement.\nThey talked about these\ncrazy materials again,\nthis titanium and polished ceramic,\nand the rectangular design,\nbut they also, then tried to\ncorrect a bunch of the things\nthat doomed the original Essential Phone.\nIt is noticeably bigger,\nand with a bigger screen,\nbigger battery, et cetera.\nBut shocker, they didn't\nreally get enough interest\nin this brand new startup phone\nto be able to bring this\nwhole idea back to life.\nIt's the classic enthusiast phone problem\nwhere like it's a cool idea,\nand some people really, really want it,\nbut there's not enough hype\nto be able to make the whole thing happen.\nThat is until Solana came along.\nSo Solana is a Web3 company\nlooking for new projects\nand OSOM is this hardware team\nlooking for some backing\nto make this phone happen.\nSo Solana would bring the\ncash and bring their backing.\nOSOM would bring their hardware talent\nand they'd partnered\ntogether to turn the OV1\ninto this rebranded\nSolana Saga, crypto phone.\nAnd it would be a thousand dollars.\nAnd that's this phone right here.\nSo all right, where do we start?\nThere's basically three things\nthat make this a crypto phone\ninstead of just another\nregular Android phone.\nSo the Solana Mobile Stack,\nthe Seed Vault and the Dapp store\nso okay, outside of those things,\nthis OV1 or the Solana phone\nis actually a very average Android phone.\nLike specs wise, it's a\nSnapdragon 8+, gen one,\nso that would be last\nyear's flagship chip,\nbut then 12 gigs of RAM and\nhalf a terabyte of storage,\nalthough it's unclear\nif it's fast UFS 3.1,\nbut it's a nice big 6.67 inch\nflat 1080p 120 hertz display,\nat the front, that gets decently bright,\nbut it is not LTPO, it's\njust a fixed refresh rate,\nand then it's powered by a\n4,100 milliamp hour battery\nwith wireless charging.\nNot great for the size of\nthis screen, but not tiny.\nAnd then it's IP 68\nwater and dust resistant\nwith a micro SD card slot\nfor storage expansion.\nBut then a pair of really\nmediocre cameras on the back.\nIt's got the same 50\nmegapixel main camera sensor\nthat's in the ROG Phone 7\nand the Oppo Find X5 pro,\nbut with worse software,\nand that's paired with a 12\nmegapixel ultra-wide camera,\nboth of which can pretty much only produce\nin perfect lighting,\nafter which things fall apart very quickly\nwith a lack of detail, excessive noise,\njust no really impressive strengths,\njust a really very heavily mixed bag here.\nBut there are two things about this phone\nthat actually I'm very impressed by,\nthat I really like, okay?\nNumber one is the materials again,\njust this world class build quality,\nbecause like I said, it's\nbasically the same team,\nthe awesome OV1 team,\nthat came from the\noriginal Essential Phone.\nAnd so they have this affinity\nfor super high quality materials.\nSo we're talking matte\nstainless steel frame\nwith colored titanium buttons\nand a full ceramic back,\nwhich yes, picks up\nfingerprints everywhere,\nother than the fingerprint reader,\nbut dude, this phone is a tank.\nThis phone is also very heavy.\nIt weighs like 250 grams,\nwhich is more than an iPhone 14 Pro Max.\nIt's got these nice squared\noff sides, that I really like.\nThere's absolutely no squeaking,\ncreaking, flexing at all.\nIt's just this hilariously,\nwell-made packaging\nof these average specs.\nBut then two, the other\nthing I really like,\naside from the crypto\nstuff, the software itself,\nonce you get into it, is\nactually extremely clean,\nvery clean, like stock Android.\nSo it is Android 13,\nand who knows when it'll\nget Android 14 if at all,\nbut you can dig through everything\nand it is very quick and\nresponsive and clean everywhere.\nIt's the stock Android quick settings,\nthe stock Android wallpaper\nand customization screens,\nall these stock Google apps,\nthe clock, the calendar,\nChrome, everything.\nNow, does any of this justify\na thousand dollar price tag?\n(exhales) Okay, well, let's see,\not's got last year's flagship spec,\nkind of weak cameras, weak battery,\nnot that amazing of a screen,\nbut it's stock Android and good build,\nnot really worth a thousand bucks, right?\nSo that's why literally less\nthan a year after it came out,\nthe price plummeted\nfrom a thousand to $600.\nSo now the real question is would you pay,\nwould anybody pay $600 for\na barely above average,\nwell-built, Android phone\nthat happens to have some\ncrypto features built in?\n(sighs) I guess this is the\npart where I have to go over\nall of the crypto and web3 features.\nSo all right, like I mentioned earlier,\nthere's three things that\nmake this a crypto phone.\nSo the Solana Mobile Stack is an SDK\nfor apps to connect to\nthis Solana blockchain,\nwhich I mean, it's cool\nthat it's built in,\nbut the obvious downside\nbeing this does not work\nwith any other blockchain.\nSo no Bitcoin, no Litecoin, no Ethereum,\nthis is just focused on\nthe Solana blockchain.\nThen the seed vault is\nbasically dedicated storage\nof a 24 phrase seed, stored\nin a secure environment,\nwhere the Android OS cannot see them,\nso that would let you unlock your wallet,\nand then the last feature\nis something I've been\ncalling a D app store,\nwhich is literally a second\napp store on this device\nthat's specifically for crypto\napps, crypto focused stuff.\nSo Phantom Wallet is on here,\nOKX, a crypto exchange is on here,\nBrave Browser, things like that.\nThere's an app called Minty Fresh\nthat lets you turn photos\nfrom your camera roll\ninto NFTs in a few\nseconds and a few clicks,\nif you're into that I guess.\nBut those are the only three things\nthat really make this a crypto phone,\nand one of 'em, the Dapp store,\nis not really even that special\nbecause it is coming to other phones\nand you'll be able to get\nit on a non crypto phone.\nSo there's that too.\nNow, the other stuff,\nI think you can actually make an argument.\nis really, really cool to\nhave built into the phone\nand actually secure like that.\nAnd if you are in the Solana ecosystem,\nthis is the only place\nyou can get that stuff.\nBut man, I feel like\nthat's about the most niche\n(laughs) feature possible.\nLike remember we were just\ntalking about the Zenfone 10,\nhow I love that phone,\nit's a super great phone.\nIt's just a shame it won't sell\nbecause not as many\npeople like small phones.\nDo you think the number of people,\nwho are in the Solana ecosystem\nand want to buy a phone\nthat has some of those features built in,\nis greater than or less\nthan the number of people\nwho want a small phone?\nBasically,\nthe number one coolest thing\nto come outta this project,\nto me, is exposing me to\nthis thing right here,\nwhich is the cable that comes\nin the box for this phone.\nThis is a braided USBC, a USBC cable,\nbut not just any cable.\nAt the end here is a hard\nswitch that blocks all data\nand only lets power through,\njust making it a charging cable,\nand that's actually pretty sick,\nhighly effective for preventing\nsomething called juice jacking attacks\nwhere if you plug into, like\na public outlet somewhere,\nbut that outlet is malicious\nand is gonna try to upload\nmalware to your device\nor download photos or something,\nthis cable will not let that\nhappen, just blocks all data.\nSo if you're plugging\ninto an extremely rare,\npublic USBC port, (laughs)\nthis is actually a great tool to have,\nbut it's also not that special\nand it's available on\nAmazon for like 30 bucks,\nso I'll also link that below.\nSo at this point, I don't\neven have to really tell you,\nbut the crypto phone is basically\na pretty standard Android phone\nwith a couple kind of cool,\nbut extremely niche crypto features\nfor one specific crypto stack,\none that happens to also\nbe tanking pretty hard\nand has been tanking for months.\nAnd I also don't even\nreally have to tell you that\nthere's basically no reason\nfor 99.99% of people to buy this.\nEven if you were to try to buy this phone,\njust for a nice clean stock Android phone,\nand just totally ignore\nall the crypto features,\nyou can get a lot more phone for 600 bucks\nfor the same price you could get a Pixel 7\nor probably Pixel 8, by\nthe time it comes out.\nYou could get a refurbished Galaxy S 23.\nYou could get any number of 1+ phones.\nI just don't think this is\nanywhere near the top of the list\nfor 600 bucks.\nAnd really that's the shame of it.\nBeing a brand new phone\ncompany is really hard\nunless your name is Carl Pay, apparently.\nAnd so I wish there was a world where\nthe OSOM OV1 could just\nexist and could thrive,\nand a small niche\ncommunity, could love it,\nbut now instead,\nthis becomes the perfect\nembodiment of crypto in 2023.\nAt best, ahead of its time,\nbut at worst, completely useless\nto most everyday people\nand gives whatever else\nis going to follow it\nan even harder uphill battle.\nThanks for watching.\nCatch you on the next one.\nPeace.\n(cheerful electronic music)\n", "punctuated_text": "(energetic electronic music) - All right, so this is a crypto phone, And I know what you're thinking: \"What the hell is a crypto

So at this point I don't even have to really tell you- but the crypto phone is basically a pretty standard Android phone with a couple kind of cool but extremely niche crypto features. for one specific crypto stack- one that happens to also be tanking pretty hard and has been tanking for months- And I also don't even really have to tell you that- there's basically no reason for 99.99% of people to buy this. Even if you were to try to buy this phone just for a nice clean stock Android phone and just totally ignore all the crypto features, you can get a lot more phone for 600 bucks. for the same price, you could get a Pixel 7 or probably Pixel 8, by the time it comes out, You could get a refurbished Galaxy S 23.. You could get any number of 1+ phones. I just don't think this is anywhere near the top of the list for 600 bucks, And really that's the shame of it. Being a brand new phone company is really hard- unless your name is Carl Pay, apparently, And so I wish there was a world where the OSOM OV1 could just exist and could thrive and a small niche community could love it. but now instead this becomes the perfect embodiment of crypto in 2023. At best ahead of its time, but at worst completely useless to most everyday people and gives whatever else is going to follow it an even harder uphill battle. Thanks for watching. Catch you on the next one: Peace (cheerful electronic music)."}, {"title": "iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!", "description": "It's time to answer the question once and for all.

Let's get into it.\nSo, all right.\nCategory number one. Customization.\nBasically, if you see this\nicon and you get excited,\nthen you probably love customization too.\nSo, digging into the settings\nand messing around with the\nhome screen and the lock screen\nand tweaking things and behaviors\nto make the device\nabsolutely perfect for you,\nI mean, it's a hobby all on its own.\nNow, at first in 2023, it\nmight actually seem like\niOS 17 and Android 14\nare pretty close, right?\nI mean, let's be real.\niOS just added a bunch\nof really good features\nthat are very well done.\nThe new lock screen update\ngives you the ability\nto change all these clock fonts and colors\nand put various super useful\nwidgets on your lock screen\nand then save a bunch of\ndifferent lock screen setups\nfor different situations\nand different focus modes,\nand then widgets were also\nadded to the home screen\nless than two years ago as well,\nso that unlocked a ton of customization\nof home screen setups displaying\nglanceable information,\nbut the more you look into it,\nthe more you realize it's\nnot actually that close,\nand a lot of this really just\ncomes down to the fact that\nApple, they do keep adding\nall these abilities,\nbut you're always restricted to\ndoing it the Apple way, the correct way,\nand so that's why a lot of iPhone setups\nstill just kind of look the same.\nLike, even if you just\ntake stock Android 14\nfrom the Google Pixel,\nwhich isn't even the most\ncustomizable version of Android,\nthere's still way more\nthat you can change,\nfrom the colors of the theme of the OS\nmatching the color of your\nwallpaper thanks to Material You\nto icon packs, custom widget sizes.\nI mean, Android will just kind of\nlet you do whatever you want.\nOn the iPhone,\nyou can't expand a widget\nto any size you want.\nYou can't put an app\njust on the right side of your\nhome screen for reachability.\nYou literally can't even place an app\nwherever you want on the home screen.\nIt must be the next up in\nthe grid of Apple's choosing.\nYou can't change the grid's size.\nYou can't change the icon sizes.\nI mean, it just takes a\nwhole bunch of extra work\nand a Siri Shortcuts hack\njust to use a custom icon.\nJust basic stuff.\nNow, I think the other\nside of that coin is\nyou can make a truly ugly,\nhorrible Android setup,\nwhere you can't really mess up\nan iPhone home screen that much.\nSo, while you can definitely argue that\niOS does it prettier,\nthe winner for most customization,\nthat would be Android.\nSo, then category number\ntwo, features, all right?\nJust straight up which\none can do more stuff.\nThis has been one of the hottest debates\nat the forefront of iOS versus Android\nconversations you always hear,\nmostly because both\nplatforms, at some level,\nlaunched missing features,\nbut especially the iPhone.\nLike, you'd always hear,\n\"Wow, can you believe the iPhone\ncan't even set wallpapers?\"\nAnd then it was, \"Can\nyou believe the iPhone\nis just now getting copy\nand paste, seriously?\"\nAnd then it's, \"Wow, it's crazy that iOS\nis just getting widgets\nnow a decade later.\"\nBut, hey, now, it's 2023 and\nthey're both very complete,\nand even in the ways that they're not,\nthey're copying each other all the time.\nYou always see a new keynote\nwith new stuff on Android,\nand you're like, that came from iOS,\nand then you'll see stuff\nfrom the iPhone keynote\nand be like, that came from Android,\nbut there's even some new stuff now\nthat the iPhone has that Android doesn't.\nA pretty good one recently is focus modes,\nwhich gives you super high\ncontrol over notifications\nin various different situations\nwith your apps and your contacts.\nThere are also a lot of privacy features,\nthings like Hide My Email with iCloud Plus\nand iCloud Private Relay.\nYou could even argue that\nDynamic Island on the Pro iPhone\nis a feature if you want to,\nbut, I mean, I just couldn't\nbecause only a small\nhandful of apps support it,\nbut it's something pretty cool and unique,\nwhich is more and more rare than ever\nin the smartphone world.\nAt this point, though,\nneither OS is really missing\nany gigantic features anymore.\nThey've both matured up to this level\nwhere they're their own character.\nThey both do a lot of stuff,\nbut I still am gonna have to give the edge\nto Android in this one\njust because there are\nso many little, like,\ntweaky, like little OS-level features,\njust little things that you\ncan tweak and change on Android\nthat still just are not on the iPhone.\nSo I'm talking like\nbattery management features\nto customized charging speeds\nor set manual charge limits\nto preserve battery life.\nThere's also an actual\nfile management system\nso you can drag and drop things\nonto your phone into certain\nfolders if you want to.\nThere's gaming-specific\nfeatures like game modes,\nthe ability to dial up and down\nyour screen's refresh\nrate whenever you want to.\nIndependent volume controls\nfor phone calls and ringtones and alarms.\nAlso, reverse wireless\ncharging comes up a lot\nfor charging wireless earbuds\nwithout breaking out a separate cable.\nReally, just, it comes down\nto the benefit of Android\nis having so much feature choice.\nThat's kind of the point,\nand this also bleeds into hardware too.\nSo, even if the feature you want\nis a huge camera with no notch,\nthen you have to get an\nAndroid phone, right?\nSo, if the feature is a super\nfast charging or a 10x camera\nor USB Type-C,\nas of right now, it's\ngotta be an Android phone.\nSo, even though they both\noffer all of the basic features\nand they appear to copy\neach other all the time\non little added stuff,\nthe winner here, again,\nis definitely Android.\nNow, number three is ease of use.\nNow, ease of use is very\nvaluable to a lot of people,\nlike a lot of people, and the\nthing about ease of use is\nit often basically has\nan inverse relationship\nwith customization and a ton of features,\n'cause there's this delicate balancing act\nyou have to do of having flexibility,\ngiving flexibility to the user,\nbut not overwhelming them\nwith a ton of buttons and settings,\nand this is really where the iPhone excels\nand has excelled for years\nas a high priority for sure,\neven in the most fundamental ways.\nThe home screen on the iPhone\nhas had up to four icons in the dock\non every iPhone since the beginning,\nand the phone icon has always been green\nand always been on the left\nevery single time for 17 years.\nThe iPhone's camera app,\nwe've all seen that stay\nfundamentally the same\nwith the viewfinder and the sliding modes.\nIt's been like that for years,\nand that kind of tucks\naway a lot of the settings\ninto a separate settings app\nand it can feel like\nit's missing features,\nbut, honestly, it's still the easiest\nand most straightforward\nfor most people to use.\nIt's like they hate changing\nthings for no good reason.\nThe calculator has basically\nbeen unchanged for years.\nNow, there's also downsides to that,\nlike Siri has basically been ignored\nsince it was introduced, but, still, like,\nApple moves the call end\nbutton by like 200 pixels\nto the middle of the screen\nand people freak out about it.\nSometimes, it feels like\nAndroid versions will\njust move stuff around\njust kind of to try it and for\nthe sake of changing things,\nand sometimes it works,\nsometimes it doesn't.\nThey'll move it back,\nand that's interesting\nand exciting sometimes,\nbut that does hurt just user\ncontinuity and ease of use.\nMaybe not for you watching this video,\nbut just think for the average person,\nlike for your five closest friends.\nThink about how they use their phone.\nYeah, then throw on top of that,\nthere's basically never any bloatware\nloaded onto the iPhone ever,\nand then customer service is\nbasically always better for an iPhone\nbecause Apple stores are everywhere\nand Apple controls that entire experience,\nfor better or for worse,\nso they get to do great\nwork with customers.\nSo it's just for people\nwho are not enthusiasts\nwho just wanna get the thing\nand not think about it anymore,\nthey pretty much always\ngo with the iPhone.\nSo ease of use is a\ncheckbox for the iPhone.\nBy the way, if you're enjoying\nthis video, get subscribed.\nWhy not? It's free.\nAll right, so we gotta talk about updates.\nSo number four is support.\nSo this is something that I would classify\nas kind of underrated,\njust because I don't think enough people\nbuy their new phone that\nthey plan on having for years\nwith this in mind.\nI think having the latest\nand greatest updates,\nsoftware, and security\npatches as quick as possible\nand as long as possible\nshould be a priority,\nbut it usually isn't for people.\nEither way, it's kind of a\nmixed bag across the board.\nIn Android world, some\ncompanies make no promises\nor they kind of break their promises.\nSome have short promises and\nsome will actually extend out\nto promising three to four\nyears of software updates.\nWeirdly, Samsung right now\nis the undisputed king of\nAndroid software updates,\nwith some rumors of maybe\nGoogle catching back up,\nbut Samsung announced in 2019\nthat all devices in 2019 or later\nwill get four years of security updates\nand some flagships will even get five,\nbut none of them really\ncome close to the iPhone.\nWhen iOS 17 comes out this fall,\nevery iPhone back to\nthe iPhone 10R from 2018\nis officially supported and\ngonna get the latest version.\nThat's five major\nsoftware version updates.\nI don't think there are any\nAndroid phones from 2018\nthat are gonna get the\nlatest version of Android 14\nwhen it comes out.\nSo this one easily goes\nto the vertically-integrated Apple phone\nwith the Apple software all day.\nSo, now, my number five category is apps.\nThis one is actually kind of fascinating.\nSo, obviously, we have our standard,\nlike our apps that we\nall use every single day\non our phones that we're used to,\nbut then sometimes it's fun\njust sort of popping around\nin the respective app stores,\ndiscovering new things, finding fun apps,\nand, at this point, they\nare both flourishing.\nThere's millions of apps now.\nThere's over three and a half million apps\nin the Google Play Store,\nand over a million and a\nhalf in Apple's App Store,\nwhich if you just stop there,\nlooks like a win for Android,\nbut quality over quantity, my friends.\nQuality over quantity.\nBasically, every major app is\navailable for both platforms,\nwhich means there are many\nmore, you know, niche apps\nor relatively unknown\npossible diamonds in the rough\non the Google Play Store,\nsure, but the difference is\nwhen you actually talk to these developers\nand observe the cycle of, like,\nhow they get made and how\nthese apps get updated,\nthe truth is so many of\nthem are prioritizing iOS,\nand, really, it's purely for efficiency.\nThink about it.\nIf you just have to update\none version of your app\nand it works with all the\nnewest iPhones instantly\nand works perfectly for millions of people\nwho all have basically\nthe same aspect ratio,\nof course you'd do it, flip that switch,\nbut, with Android,\nthere are naturally\nmany more complexities.\nThere are a bunch of different devices\nthat all have different aspect ratios\nand different pixel densities\nand different feature\nsupport and even foldables,\nand it's like it's a lot more work\nto get all of those users up to date\nwith the same level of optimization.\nIt's a lot of different switches to flip,\nso a lot of 'em just don't\ngo through all of that\nor they take way longer to.\nSo the number of titles is one thing,\nbut is it the same Instagram\napp on both iPhone and Android?\nIs it the same Threads app on each one?\nAs someone who's been\ncarrying and using both phones\nand often using the\nsame app on both phones,\nI have a firsthand experience\nof knowing that, often,\neven with some of Google's own apps,\nthe updates are prioritized on the iPhone.\nThey come first to the iPhone\nbefore they come to Android.\nI wish that wasn't true.\nI wish they were just as\neasy to do one or the other,\nbut that's just the truth of it.\nSo the slight app advantage is\ngonna go to the iPhone here,\nand interestingly enough,\nthis also applies\ngenerally to accessories.\nAgain, same reason, same efficiency,\nbut that's a win for the iPhone.\nSo then, category number six,\nI'm gonna go a little more\nsubjective with this one,\nbut I still think it\nmatters, which is excitement.\nWhich one is more interesting or exciting\nin the moment to you?\nNow, honestly, I get pretty excited\nfor a lot of different\nnew tech these days,\nand, actually, because there's only\nlike one or two new\niPhone drops every year,\nit's actually very easy\nto get hype built up for the new iPhone,\nbut it's definitely a\ndifferent type of excitement\nwith the massive variety of\nnew innovations and things\nthat come to Android phones all the time.\nLike, if you just are\ninterested in folding phones,\nwell, there's more Android\nreleases than ever for that.\nWant a gaming phone? There's\ngonna be an Android for that.\nDo you want a headphone jack?\nDo you want a compact phone?\nDo you want the world's fastest charging?\nDo you want some interesting\nnew unique designs\nor materials or textures\nor experimental features?\nLike, that is the world of Android,\nand if you think about it,\nseriously think about this,\nmost of the interesting excitement\naround every new iPhone\nlaunch, the question really is,\nis this new iPhone going\nto get a new feature\nthat's been in Android phones for years?\nLike, are we finally gonna\nget USB-C on an iPhone?\nAre we finally gonna get\nfast charging on an iPhone?\nAre we finally gonna get a 5x camera?\nAnd so just for that novelty reason alone,\nthe excitement category,\nthat's definitely gotta go to Android.\nSo that brings us to my last category,\nnumber seven, ecosystem.\nWe've heard this word before, ecosystem.\nSo, okay, say what you want,\nbut there are a lot of people\nwho will not buy a phone\nif it doesn't have iMessage\nor FaceTime, whatever it is,\nand Apple has weaponized this\nand built walls around this\nand closed it off as much as possible.\nTechnically, you can join a\nFaceTime from an Android phone,\nbut you can't start one.\nSo I made an entire video\njust about Apple's ecosystem.\nHate it or love it, it is\nimportant to some people.\nNow, the thing is\nApple is not the only\none with an ecosystem.\nLike, look at Samsung for example.\nApple happens to build bigger walls\naround keeping people\ninto their ecosystem,\nbut Samsung has a lot of\nequivalents to all the same pieces.\nLike, you could get a\nSamsung Galaxy S flagship\nand you could quickly and easily\nconnect your Galaxy\nBuds just like AirPods.\nYou put on your Galaxy watch\nwith a lot of the same\nfeatures as the Apple watch.\nYou tether to a Samsung Tab\njust for entertainment purposes,\nlike an iPad, but then\nyou get a Galaxy Book Pro\nwith cellular internet sharing\nand wireless Quick Share,\njust like a MacBook Pro with AirDrop.\nYou see where I'm going? It\njust keeps going and going.\nI'm sure Samsung is\neventually gonna come out\nwith their smart speaker\nto match the home pod.\nIt's totally, totally\ncoming, but on paper,\nthe idea is they are\nsurprisingly congruent.\nSo, the way I see it, at\nthe time of this recording,\n'cause this could change very\nsoon in the next couple weeks,\nbut the main advantages\nof Samsung's ecosystem\nwould be things like one USB-C\nacross literally everything,\nso you can use one charging\ncable for all of your stuff.\nTwo, they make more\ndifferent versions of devices\nthat fit into the ecosystem.\nLike, there are a ton of different phones\nand a bunch of different watches\nand different headphones\nand laptops, et cetera,\nso there's more flexibility\nand hardware choice.\nClassic Android, plus Samsung\nalso makes other stuff\nthat connects, like\ndishwashers and refrigerators,\nbut then the advantages\nof Apple's ecosystem,\nnot just in the US, but especially here,\nare, first of all, ease\nof use and seamlessness.\nLike, it is genuinely crazy how good\nsome of the continuity stuff\nis in Apple's ecosystem.\nLike, something like Continuity Camera\nis so sick every time.\nYou just push one button\nto use a super high quality\niPhone camera as your webcam.\nIt works very, very well,\nbut then the popularity\nfactor, especially in the US,\nmakes things like FaceTime and iMessage\nand the Find My Network super strong.\nSo I can make a whole video on this.\nI could put up the\nstrengths and weaknesses\nand put up just these two\necosystems up against each other,\nbut, as of right now,\nthey're both very strong,\nand I'm gonna give the\nslight edge to Apple's,\njust because, one, I'm in the US\nand that advantage is strong,\nbut, two, just because of the seamlessness\nand how well things are integrated\nand the continuity features are unreal.\nSo, if we tally these all up here,\nyou can see that the objective winner,\nin four out of the seven\ncategories that I made up,\nis the iPhone, but put\nyour pitchforks down.\nGuess what?\nAs you've probably picked up\nfrom the beginning of this video,\nthere is no objective winner\nto a decision as personal as this one\nand when the options are this close.\nYou probably already know,\nif you've been watching my videos,\nyou know I main an Android phone\nmost of the time alongside an iPhone,\nbut my main phone and my\nmain customized setups\nare on the Android phone, so what gives?\nLike, picking one de facto\nwinner kind of suggests that\nthe one winner is best for everyone,\nbut we already know that there's\nsome people who literally\ndon't care about some features\nthat some others would say\nthey can't live without.\nSo I've devised a very basic system\nto help you pick your winner for yourself,\nand it's really quite simple.\nAll you have to do\nis put these seven categories\nin order of importance to you\nand then rate each one of them\nlet's say on a scale from one to five.\nSo give them a one to five point rating\nbased on how much you care about it.\nSo, here, for me, I care the most about\ncustomization and features.\nThen I care a lot about apps,\nand excitement and updates\nare decently important,\nbut then in my daily driver,\nease of use and ecosystem\naren't that big of a deal.\nI've got a mixed bag.\nSo then I just give the\namount of points earned\nto each winner of that category.\nSo the winner for me is clearly Android,\nbut, hey, for you,\nmaybe you care a lot about\necosystem and maybe nothing else.\nI'm sure you know someone like this.\nThen the iPhone will clearly\nbe calling your name,\nor if you're the type who wants\nall the features and\nexcitement in the world,\nwell, then Android probably\nis what's in your pocket.\nYou might even have your own\ncategory you could add in\nthat's heavily weighted.\nI kind of see it like buying a car.\nLike maybe Cool Factor\nis in there. Have at it.\nIt turns out buying a phone\nis one of the most personal\ndecisions you make.\nI've said this before, but, like,\nit's the thing you spent your money on\nand you carry everywhere you go,\nand so that's why people\nget so worked up about\nthis side versus that side,\nbut, at the end of the day,\nthe winner, not to be cheesy, is us,\nbecause they're competing\nagainst each other to get better\nto hopefully win you over, and\nthat's the way it should be.\nThanks for watching.\nCatch you in the next one.\nPeace.\n(upbeat music)\n\u266a Ooh \u266a\n", "punctuated_text": "(upbeat music). \u266a Ooh \u266a. -. All right, welcome to the definitive iPhone versus Android video. It's the impossible debate, right? In a lot of ways. people just get so entrenched on one side that they never wanna flip to the other side, To each their own. You hear that all the time. but I have a solution. So here's how we're gonna do this. So I'm gonna break this down into seven actually meaningful categories. so it's an odd number, so there has to be a winner, no tie. but since we're not psychos and we know that one winner doesn't automatically apply to every human on earth, I'm actually gonna give you a system, a rubric, to help figure out the real winner for yourself. You'll see what I mean. Let's get into it. So, all right. Category number one: Customization. Basically, if you see this icon and you get excited, then you probably love customization too. So digging into the settings and messing around with the home screen and the lock screen and tweaking things and behaviors to make the device absolutely perfect for you, I mean, it's a hobby all on its own. Now at first, in 2023, it might actually seem like iOS 17 and Android 14 are pretty close, right, I mean, let's be real. iOS just added a bunch of really good features that are very well done. The new lock screen update gives you the ability to change all these clock fonts and colors and put various super useful widgets on your lock screen and then save a bunch of different lock screen setups for different situations and different focus modes. and then widgets were also added to the home screen less than two years ago as well, so that unlocked a ton of customization of home screen setups displaying glanceable information. but the more you look into it, the more you realize it's not actually that close, and a lot of this really just comes down to the fact that Apple they do keep adding all these abilities, but you're always restricted to doing it the Apple way, the correct way, and so that's why a lot of iPhone setups still just kind of look the same Like. even if you just take stock Android 14 from the Google Pixel, which isn't even the most customizable version of Android, there's still way more that you can change, from the colors of the theme of the OS, matching the color of your wallpaper thanks to Material You to icon packs, custom widget sizes. I mean Android will just kind of let you do whatever you want. On the iPhone you can't expand a widget to any size you want. You can't put an app just on the right side of your home screen for reachability. You literally can't even place an app wherever you want on the home screen: It must be the next up in the grid of Apple's choosing. You can't change the grid's size. You can't change the icon sizes. I mean it just takes a whole bunch of extra work and a Siri Shortcuts hack just to use a custom icon, Just basic stuff. Now I think the other side of that coin is you can make a truly ugly, horrible Android setup where you can't really mess up an iPhone home screen that much. So while you can definitely argue that iOS does it prettier, the winner for most customization that would be Android. So then, category number two, features. all right, Just straight up, which one can do more stuff? This has been one of the hottest debates at the forefront of iOS versus Android conversations. you always hear- mostly because both platforms at some level launched missing features, but especially the iPhone, Like you'd always hear: \"Wow, can you believe the iPhone can't even set wallpapers\", And then it was \"Can you believe the iPhone is just now getting copy and paste seriously\", And then it's \"Wow, it's crazy that iOS is just getting widgets now, a decade later\", But hey, now it's 2023 and they're both very complete and, even in the ways that they're not, they're copying each other all the time. You always see a new keynote with new stuff on Android and you're like that came from iOS. and then you'll see stuff from the iPhone keynote and be like that came from Android, but there's even some new stuff now that the iPhone has that Android doesn't. A pretty good one recently is focus modes, which gives you super high control over notifications in various different situations with your apps and your contacts. There are also a lot of privacy features, things like Hide My Email with iCloud Plus and iCloud Private Relay. You could even argue that Dynamic Island on the Pro iPhone is a feature if you want to, but I mean, I just couldn't because only a small handful of apps support it, but it's something pretty cool and unique, which is more and more rare than ever in the smartphone world. At this point, though, neither OS is really missing any gigantic features anymore. They've both matured up to this level where they're their own character. They both do a lot of stuff, but I still am gonna have to give the edge to Android in this one, just because there are so many little like tweaky, like little OS-level features, just little things that you can tweak and change on Android that still just are not on the iPhone. So I'm talking like battery management features to customized charging speeds or set manual charge limits to preserve battery life. There's also an actual file management system so you can drag and drop things onto your phone into certain folders if you want to. There's gaming-specific features like game modes, the ability to dial up and down your screen's refresh rate whenever you want to, Independent volume controls for phone calls and ringtones and alarms. Also, reverse wireless charging comes up a lot for charging wireless earbuds without breaking out a separate cable. Really, just, it comes down to, the benefit of Android is having so much feature choice. That's kind of the point, and this also bleeds into hardware too. So even if the feature you want is a huge camera with no notch, then you have to get an Android phone right. So if the feature is a super fast charging or a 10x camera or USB Type-C, as of right now, it's gotta be an Android phone. So, even though they both offer all of the basic features and they appear to copy each other all the time on little added stuff. the winner here again is definitely Android. Now, number three is ease of use. Now, ease of use is very valuable to a lot of people, like a lot of people, and the thing about ease of use is it often basically has an inverse relationship with customization and a ton of features, 'cause there's this delicate balancing act you have to do of having flexibility, giving flexibility to the user but not overwhelming them with a ton of buttons and settings. and this is really where the iPhone excels and has excelled for years as a high priority for sure, even in the most fundamental ways. The home screen on the iPhone has had up to four icons in the dock on every iPhone since the beginning, and the phone icon has always been green and always been on the left every single time for 17 years. The iPhone's camera app- we've all seen that- stay fundamentally the same with the viewfinder and the sliding modes. It's been like that for years and that kind of tucks away a lot of the settings into a separate settings app and it can feel like it's missing features, but honestly it's still the easiest and most straightforward for most people to use. It's like they hate changing things for no good reason. The calculator has basically been unchanged for years. Now there's also downsides to that. like Siri has basically been ignored since it was introduced, but still. like Apple moves the call end button by like 200 pixels to the middle of the screen and people freak out about it. Sometimes it feels like Android versions will just move stuff around just kind of to try it and for the sake of changing things, and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. They'll move it back and that's interesting and exciting sometimes, but that does hurt just user continuity and ease of use. Maybe not for you watching this video, but just think for the average person, like for your five closest friends. Think about how they use their phone. Yeah, then throw on top of that, there's basically never any bloatware loaded onto the iPhone ever. and then customer service is basically always better for an iPhone because Apple stores are everywhere and Apple controls that entire experience for better or for worse. so they get to do great work with customers. So it's just for people who are not enthusiasts, who just wanna get the thing and not think about it anymore. they pretty much always go with the iPhone. So ease of use is a checkbox for the iPhone. By the way, if you're enjoying this video. get subscribed, Why not? It's free, All right. so we gotta talk about updates. So number four is support. So this is something that I would classify as kind of underrated, just because I don't think enough people buy their new phone that they plan on having for years. with this in mind, I think having the latest and greatest updates, software and security patches as quick as possible and as long as possible should be a priority, but it usually isn't for people. Either way, it's kind of a mixed bag across the board In Android world. some companies make no promises or they kind of break their promises. Some have short promises and some will actually extend out to promising three to four years of software updates. Weirdly, Samsung right now is the undisputed king of Android software updates, with some rumors of maybe Google catching back up. but Samsung announced in 2019 that all devices in 2019 or later will get four years of security updates, and some flagships will even get five, but none of them really come close to the iPhone. When iOS 17 comes out this fall, every iPhone- back to the iPhone 10R from 2018- is officially supported and gonna get the latest version. That's five major software version updates. I don't think there are any Android phones from 2018 that are gonna get the latest version of Android 14 when it comes out. So this one easily goes to the vertically-integrated Apple phone with the Apple software all day. So now my number five category is apps. This one is actually kind of fascinating. So obviously we have our standard, like our apps that we all use every single day on our phones, that we're used to. but then sometimes it's fun just sort of popping around in the respective app stores discovering new things, finding fun apps, and at this point they are both flourishing. There's millions of apps. now. There's over three and a half million apps in the Google Play Store and over a million and a half in Apple's App Store, which, if you just stop there, looks like a win for Android. but quality over quantity, my friends, Quality over quantity. Basically, every major app is available for both platforms, which means there are many more, you know, niche apps or relatively unknown, possible diamonds in the rough on the Google Play Store. sure, but the difference is when you actually talk to these developers and observe the cycle of like, how they get made and how these apps get updated. the truth is so many of them are prioritizing iOS, and really it's purely for efficiency. Think about it: If you just have to update one version of your app and it works with all the newest iPhones instantly and works perfectly for millions of people who all have basically the same aspect ratio, of course you'd do it flip that switch. but with Android there are naturally many more complexities. There are a bunch of different devices that all have different aspect ratios and different pixel densities and different feature support and even foldables, and it's like it's a lot more work to get all of those users up to date with the same level of optimization. It's a lot of different switches to flip, so a lot of 'em just don't go through all of that or they take way longer to. So the number of titles is one thing, but is it the same Instagram app on both iPhone and Android? Is it the same Threads app on each one? As someone who's been carrying and using both phones, and often using the same app on both phones, I have a firsthand experience of knowing that often, even with some of Google's own apps, the updates are prioritized on the iPhone. They come first to the iPhone before they come to Android. I wish that wasn't true. I wish they were just as easy to do one or the other, but that's just the truth of it. So the slight app advantage is gonna go to the iPhone here, and interestingly enough, this also applies generally to accessories. Again, same reason, same efficiency, but that's a win for the iPhone. So then category number six. I'm gonna go a little more subjective with this one, but I still think it matters which is excitement, Which one is more interesting or exciting in the moment to you. Now, honestly, I get pretty excited for a lot of different new tech these days, and actually, because there's only like one or two new iPhone drops every year, it's actually very easy to get hype built up for the new iPhone. but it's definitely a different type of excitement with the massive variety of new innovations and things that come to Android phones all the time. Like, if you just are interested in folding phones, well, there's more Android releases than ever for that. Want a gaming phone, There's gonna be an Android for that. Do you want a headphone jack? Do you want a compact phone? Do you want the world's fastest charging? Do you want some interesting new, unique designs or materials or textures or experimental features? Like that is the world of Android, and if you think about it seriously, think about this. most of the interesting excitement around every new iPhone launch, the question really is: is this new iPhone going to get a new feature that's been in Android phones for years, Like, are we finally gonna get USB-C on an iPhone? Are we finally gonna get fast charging on an iPhone? Are we finally gonna get a 5x camera? And so, just for that novelty reason alone, the excitement category that's definitely gotta go to Android. So that brings us to my last category, number seven: ecosystem. We've heard this word before, ecosystem. So okay, say what you want, but there are a lot of people who will not buy a phone if it doesn't have iMessage or FaceTime, whatever it is. and Apple has weaponized this and built walls around this and closed it off as much as possible. Technically, you can join a FaceTime from an Android phone, but you can't start one. So I made an entire video just about Apple's ecosystem. Hate it or love it, it is important to some people. Now the thing is, Apple is not the only one with an ecosystem, Like, look at Samsung, for example. Apple happens to build bigger walls around keeping people into their ecosystem, but Samsung has a lot of equivalents to all the same pieces, Like you could get a Samsung Galaxy S flagship and you could quickly and easily connect your Galaxy Buds, just like AirPods. You put on your Galaxy watch with a lot of the same features as the Apple watch. You tether to a Samsung Tab, just for entertainment purposes, like an iPad, but then you get a Galaxy Book Pro with cellular internet sharing and wireless Quick Share, just like a MacBook Pro with AirDrop. You see where I'm going. It just keeps going and going. I'm sure Samsung is eventually gonna come out with their smart speaker to match the home pod. It's totally, totally coming, but on paper the idea is they are surprisingly congruent. So the way I see it at the time of this recording 'cause this could change very soon in the next couple weeks- but the main advantages of Samsung's ecosystem would be things like one USB-C across literally everything, so you can use one charging cable for all of your stuff. Two, they make more different versions of devices that fit into the ecosystem, Like there are a ton of different phones and a bunch of different watches and different headphones and laptops et cetera. so there's more flexibility and hardware choice, Classic Android plus. Samsung also makes other stuff that connects, like dishwashers and refrigerators. but then the advantages of Apple's ecosystem, not just in the US but especially here, are, first of all, ease of use and seamlessness. Like it is genuinely crazy how good some of the continuity stuff is in Apple's ecosystem. Like something like Continuity Camera is so sick. every time You just push one button to use a super high quality iPhone camera as your webcam. It works very, very well. but then the popularity factor, especially in the US, makes things like FaceTime and iMessage and the Find My Network super strong. So I can make a whole video on this. I could put up the strengths and weaknesses and put up just these two ecosystems up against each other, but as of right now they're both very strong and I'm gonna give the slight edge to Apple's just because, one, I'm in the US and that advantage is strong, but two, just because of the seamlessness and how well things are integrated and the continuity features are unreal. So if we tally these all up here, you can see that the objective winner in four out of the seven categories that I made up is the iPhone. but put your pitchforks down. Guess what, As you've probably picked up from the beginning of this video, there is no objective winner to a decision as personal as this one and when the options are this close. You probably already know if you've been watching my videos. you know I main an Android phone most of the time alongside an iPhone, but my main phone and my main customized setups are on the Android phone. so what gives Like picking one de facto winner, kind of suggests that the one winner is best for everyone. but we already know that there's some people who literally don't care about some features that some others would say they can't live without. So I've devised a very basic system to help you pick your winner for yourself, and it's really quite simple. All you have to do is put these seven categories in order of importance to you and then rate each one of them, let's say, on a scale from one to five. So give them a one to five point rating based on how much you care about it. So here for me, I care the most about customization and features. Then I care a lot about apps, and excitement and updates are decently important, but then in my daily driver, ease of use and ecosystem aren't that big of a deal. I've got a mixed bag, So then I just give the amount of points earned to each winner of that category. So the winner for me is clearly Android. but hey, for you- maybe you care a lot about ecosystem and maybe nothing else- I'm sure you know someone like this- Then the iPhone will clearly be calling your name. or if you're the type who wants all the features and excitement in the world, well then Android probably is what's in your pocket. You might even have your own category you could add in that's heavily weighted. I kind of see it like buying a car, Like maybe Cool Factor is in there. Have at it. It turns out buying a phone is one of the most personal decisions you make- I've said this before- but like it's the thing you spent your money on and you carry everywhere you go. and so that's why people get so worked up about this side versus that side. but at the end of the day, the winner- not to be cheesy- is us, because they're competing against each other to get better, to hopefully win you over, and that's the way it should be. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one.

{"text": "See you in the next one, peace.", "start": 720.75, "duration": 1.863}], "text": "- So this is Cleo\nand as you can probably immediately tell,\nCleo is an awesome dog.\nShe's one of the nicest\ndogs I've ever met.\nShe loves people, anyone\nthat'll give her any food.\nShe's pretty classic dog stuff\nand she also happens to\nbe missing her right leg.\nShe was found on Petfinder\nafter she spent some time\nas a stray in Oklahoma with\ninjuries from unknown causes.\nNow hanging out with Cleo\nand just playing with her,\nlike you'd almost forget,\nlike you wouldn't even know\nthat she's missing a leg 'cause\nshe's just running around,\nchasing stuff, playing fetch,\nshe loves being outdoors,\nall that classic dog stuff.\nBut although she appears\nsuper healthy now,\ndogs that are missing limbs\nand any pets that are missing limbs\nare actually more likely to\nhave things like arthritis\nand joint problems in their\nother limbs later in life\n'cause they're compensating\nfor the missing limb.\nSo she's running around being awesome now,\nbut it would be ideal for\nher long term to be supported\nso that's where this company\ncalled 3D Pets comes in.\nSo they reached out and\nthey were telling me\nthey have a particularly\nhigh tech solution\nto the problem and asked if\nI basically want to go see it\nand it turns out it is pretty sick.\nI mean, I've already\ntalked about this before,\nbut there's tech in everything.\nLike every story, every\nangle, everything I see\non the news nowadays,\nit has some tech in it,\nbut even this story surprised me at just\nhow much tech was involved\nin helping dogs like Cleo.\nSo it's this multi-step process.\nFirst up is this scan.\nSo the pet comes into their studio,\nwhich is actually in New Jersey,\npretty close to our video studio\nand they actually use a smartphone\nto 3D scan the animal.\nSo the idea is to take a few scans,\nthey actually use the\niPhone's LIDAR scanner\nor use the true depth\ncamera system or both.\nThis isn't exactly what\nthey were designed for,\nbut with apps like combed and hedges,\nit is a pretty clever solution\nfor just basic measuring.\nSo basically once you get Cleo\nto hold still for long enough,\nyou can get a pretty\ndecently accurate scan\nof her dimensions.\nHow high off the ground she is,\nhow far around, the\nshape of the prosthesis,\nwhat that needs to be, et cetera\nand all of this is to be\nused in the next step,\nwhich is 3D printing the\nprosthesis, it's crazy.\nNow you might be thinking\nlike I was at the beginning\nof this, wait a second,\nwhy is there so much tech\nbeing used in this process?\nLike why is it 3D scanning the animal\nand then 3D printing the prosthesis?\nWhat's going on here?\nAnd the real answer\nas they explained it to\nme basically is because\nevery single animal's situation\nis a little bit different.\nNo two are exactly the same\nwhether it's the reason\nthat they lost the limb\nor part of the limb,\nbut then just like the size of\nthe animal, how big are they?\nHow far off the ground does the limb end?\nHow much weight are they\ngonna be able to put on it?\nAll these different things\nare slightly different\nfor every single animal, it's\nkind of like a fingerprint.\nSo clearly you can't just mass produce\nlike one size fits all prosthetic.\nObviously even with humans,\nyou know this is is already true,\nbut the idea is you want it\nto be as custom and bespoke\nand comfortable for every\nsingle animal as possible\nso this 3D printing process allows\nfor rapid reiteration and making\na couple different versions\ntill you get it exactly right\nand so this is why\nthey're doing it this way.\n3D pets in particular, they've worked with\nover 300 different animals\nso far at their studio.\nThey actually start with a\ncandidacy form on their website.\nBut then once they get going,\nthey have a ton of options.\nTo date, they've done many dogs as pets,\nbut also some ducks, a tortoise, a pig.\nThey had a goat recently that\nwas missing part of its skull\nthat didn't form properly and\ngoats like to use their heads\nfor stuff obviously\nso they made a helmet for him\nand one elephant leg recently.\nSo anyway, Cleo's scan\npretty straightforward\nand within five minutes they have a couple\ndecently accurate models to work with\nand then they import it into the computer\nto move to step two.\nSo how do you get the scan off the phone?\n- Well that's the easy part.\nWe get the scan off the\nphone onto our web portal,\nwhich we're able to bring\ninto a custom design software here\nwhere that's really\nwhere the magic happens,\nwhere we're able to take a design\nand really mold it to\nthe 3D scan of each pet\nso that we can make sure\neverything's fitting perfect.\n- So this is Cleo's scan,\nand the appropriate fit as it\nwould be built on the scan?\n- Right, so you can see the scan overlaid\nand we can patch things up as needed.\nIt's almost like 3D Photoshop in a way,\nbut then we're able to\ncontrol the lattice,\nthe hardware mounts, where the straps go,\nwe can really position\neverything perfect to each pet.\nAnd then once we're happy, once it's set,\nthen we bring it into another software\nwhere this is where we\noptimize it for printing.\nSo we have to be able to basically\ngive the printer\ninstruction on what to make.\nSo this is where we really fine tune\nthe intricacies and the\ndetail of each layer\n'cause again, we want\nsome areas to be nice\nand rigid where hardware\nmounts, for example.\nBut like around the rib\ncage, around the lungs,\nwe want the flexibility\nso you can see we don't have\nthat thick lattice there.\nThis over here, these wings\nwe can really easily bend\neven if the dog fluctuates in weight,\nwe want it to accommodate those changes.\nBut where the mount is, where\nthe hardware is on this end,\nthis we want to be\nreally sturdy and strong\n'cause that's where the impact is.\nSo once we're happy with\nthis, once it's ready to go,\nwe'll take it over to\none of the 3D printers\nand we have a whole\nbunch of different sizes\ndepending on the case,\ndepending on the animal,\nbut they're all pretty\nsimilar in how they work.\n- So 3D printing, to be perfectly honest,\nI never really cared that\nmuch about 3D printing.\nThis is like a confession.\nLike I never...\nThere was a ton of hype about it\nand obviously a lot of\npeople care a lot about it,\nbut every time I was brought up to me,\nI couldn't really find a reason to care\nand we got a 3D printer at the studio\nand we've printed a couple\nrandom trinkets here and there,\nmostly things that are\njust like useless stuff\njust to see if it'll work.\nWhatever, neat, but this is the first time\nI've seen a situation where\n3D printing clearly makes\nthe most sense for a\nmanufacturing process.\nObviously you can't do one single mold,\nyou can't do one size fits all\nso like I said,\nit just made the most sense for once.\nThey have a couple different\nsize printers in here\nranging from something like an Anker M5,\nsomething you might buy on Amazon\nall the way up to an industrial sized one,\nthe size of a refrigerator,\nbasically to work\non different sized pieces\nfor different animals.\nSo once they were happy with Cleo's design\nof the prosthesis in the\nsoftware, it hits the printer\nand about literally 24\nhours later, it's done,\nit's printed, the whole thing.\nNow this isn't the final step for hers.\nThere is still a sanding down\nprocess to soften the corners\nand make it as comfortable as possible\nand also in 3D printing,\nthere's commonly these\nsupport pieces that you get\nwhen you print oddly shaped\nobjects that need to be cut off\nand they're actually working\non ways to melt that down\nand use it in other\nthings like wheels or feet\nso they can actually be\nresourceful about that as well,\nbut they've showed me a bunch\nof examples of various shapes\nand sizes of things they've\nprinted for animals in the past.\n- So this one is just\nabout ready to ship out.\nThis dog has a residual limb.\nSo we have this build out\nhere and we do it like this\nso that we can keep\nthe weight bearing load\nright below where the limb used to be.\nIf we have it in any other place,\nthey just won't be able to walk correctly.\n- And this is also now softened down\nand it is just sanded, basically?\n- We do a sand and torch.\nSo we'll basically burn the material back\nlike what the machine\nis doing, heating it up\nto a melting temperature,\nit smooths it out.\nAnd something that we're\nvery well known for\nwith our devices are our feet.\nAnd so one of the biggest\nthings is when the dogs\nare taking steps, you want that\nfoot to be able to compress\nto absorb that.\nI'll trade you.\nI think this is version\nlike five or six of the foot\nand we're on version like\n10 or 12 of the harness\nso they're constantly\nchanging and adapting.\nIf somebody reaches\nout to us and they say,\nI burned through a foot,\nhere are the reasons why,\nwe're gonna make the changes to the foot\nso that stops happening.\nAnd so that's why we go\nthrough our variations.\nWe're actually working on\nthe next version of the foot,\nwhich has rounder edges\nso more of a radius on these edges.\n- Like a tire maybe?\n- Yeah, yeah, exactly like a tire\nbecause dogs tend to lean\non one side or the other\nand we'll typically have\nthe owners flip it around\nonce they start to wear on one side\nso it wears evenly.\n- A tire rotation?\n- Exactly, a foot rotation.\nAnd then behind you, we\nhave some of our carts\nthat are in process too.\nSo this is one going\ndown to a dog in Texas.\nShe's got two deformed limbs.\nIn fact one is really not formed at all,\nbut she's got one deformed\nhere on the left hand side.\nSo we make provisions for that\nso that the shoulders\ncan still move around.\nSo this'll get three six\ninch wheels on each corner.\nAnd then this, this is\nanother good example.\nThis is for a dachshund that\nhas one full remaining leg\nand had a partial amputation.\nAnd so the owners didn't want\nsomething extremely bulky,\nbut they wanted that\nfront leg to have support\n'cause dachshunds have\na lot of back problems.\nSo we designed this\nspecifically for this case\nwhere the dachshund can\nput its legs and move it\nand still have the\nsupport on the outer edges\nand we still have our\nflexible harness here.\nAnd the wheels can\nchange camber as well too\nso depending on--\n- Sport mode.\n- And we'll go up to\neight or 10 inch wheels.\nI think you saw this one.\n- That Escalade dogs.\n- We should do spinners\non one of these rooms\none of these days honestly.\nI haven't put it past people.\nThe woman that we did our\noriginal dachshund cart for,\nshe saw our black wheels and she was like,\nI'd like silver rims, please,\nand I thought she was joking.\nI totally thought she was joking\nand I was like, oh, that's a cool idea.\nShe was like, no, really\nI want silver wheels.\n- Would you paint it or would you--\n- We ended up painting it.\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n- So, Cleo's scan was pretty good.\nThen they designed her prosthesis\naround that scan, that went great.\nThen they printed it, sanded\nit, and torched it down\nand matched it with\nthe leg for her height.\nThe only step left now\nis to see how it works.\nSo what I kind of didn't realize is\nit's not just like you attach\nthe prosthesis to the dog\nand then they just magically\nstart running around perfectly\nlike they've had it their whole life.\nBut no, like anyone who's\nhad crutches knows this,\nthere's actually an adjustment process\nas you get more and more used to it.\nSo I got to watch Cleo\nsort of learn in real time\neven in just these few\nminutes, go from hovering it\noff the ground to eventually\nstarting to trust it.\nAnd the process of them getting used to it\ndepending on the pet is\nbasically to introduce them\nto more and more time per day with it\nso that they eventually get\nused to totally living with it.\nMaybe 20 minutes a day at the beginning,\nthen it's an hour a day,\nthen two hours a day\nand you slowly see them start\nto remap their muscle memory\nand unlearn walking without the limb\nand really trust it and\ndepend on it by the end.\nSo at the end of the day, I\nthought this was super cool\nand basically it's a huge\nwin for pets like Cleo\nand it's also super cool\nthat it's enabled by tech that\nfeels relatively accessible,\nlike a phone in our\npocket, a computer app,\none or two pieces of\nsoftware and then 3D printers\nlike all things that we\ncan get started with,\nthat's how they got started\nwith building this studio\nin New Jersey and actually\nhelping so many pets\nand they actually now will\ncontinue to evolve this.\nThere's other places around the country\nin the world doing the same sort of thing,\nbut they potentially\ncan do remote creations\nfor pets that don't come to the studio\nbut they get to like send a mold in\nand then build a prosthesis\nfor other animals\nthey don't even get to see.\nI'm not even gonna pretend to be an expert\non 3D printing or prosthesis,\nbut like hopefully this helps more animals\nsort of extend their\nlives and live more freely\nI think is the right word.\nThese pieces are typically priced\nfrom a couple 100 bucks\nto up to 1,000 or $2,000\nand ideally will last a lifetime\nat least if they've stopped growing.\nSo thanks to 3D Pets\nfor letting me pull back\nthe curtain a little bit\ninto how they use tech to do what they do.\nThanks to Cleo for letting\nme hang out all day\nand thanks to you for watching.\nSee you in the next one, peace.\n", "punctuated_text": "- So this is Cleo and, as you can probably immediately tell, Cleo is an awesome dog. She's one of the nicest dogs I've ever met. She loves people, anyone that'll give her any food. She's pretty classic dog stuff and she also happens to be missing her right leg. She was found on Petfinder after she spent some time as a stray in Oklahoma with injuries from unknown causes. Now, hanging out with Cleo and just playing with her, like you'd almost forget, like you wouldn't even know, that she's missing a leg, 'cause she's just running around chasing stuff, playing fetch, she loves being outdoors, all that classic dog stuff. But although she appears super healthy now, dogs that are missing limbs, and any pets that are missing limbs, are actually more likely to have things like arthritis and joint problems in their other limbs later in life, 'cause they're compensating for the missing limb. So she's running around being awesome now, but it would be ideal for her long term to be supported. so that's where this company called 3D Pets comes in. So they reached out and they were telling me they have a particularly high tech solution to the problem and asked if I basically want to go see it. and it turns out it is pretty sick. I mean, I've already talked about this before, but there's tech in everything, Like every story, every angle, everything I see on the news nowadays it has some tech in it. but even this story surprised me at just how much tech was involved in helping dogs like Cleo. So it's this multi-step process. First up is this scan. So the pet comes into their studio, which is actually in New Jersey, pretty close to our video studio, and they actually use a smartphone to 3D scan the animal. So the idea is to take a few scans. they actually use the iPhone's LIDAR scanner or use the true depth camera system or both. This isn't exactly what they were designed for, but with apps like combed and hedges, it is a pretty clever solution for just basic measuring. So basically, once you get Cleo to hold still for long enough, you can get a pretty decently accurate scan of her dimensions: How high off the ground she is, how far around the shape of the prosthesis, what that needs to be, et cetera. and all of this is to be used in the next step, which is 3D printing the prosthesis. it's crazy. Now you might be thinking like I was at the beginning of this. wait a second. why is there so much tech being used in this process, Like: why is it 3D scanning the animal and then 3D printing the prosthesis? What's going on here? And the real answer, as they explained it to me basically, is because every single animal's situation is a little bit different. No two are exactly the same, whether it's the reason that they lost the limb or part of the limb. but then, just like the size of the animal, how big are they? How far off the ground does the limb end? How much weight are they gonna be able to put on it? All these different things are slightly different for every single animal. it's kind of like a fingerprint. So clearly you can't just mass produce like one size fits all prosthetic. Obviously, even with humans, you know this is is already true, but the idea is you want it to be as custom and bespoke and comfortable for every single animal as possible. so this 3D printing process allows for rapid reiteration and making a couple different versions till you get it exactly right, and so this is why they're doing it this way, 3D pets in particular. they've worked with over 300 different animals so far at their studio. They actually start with a candidacy form on their website, But then, once they get going, they have a ton of options. To date they've done many dogs as pets, but also some ducks, a tortoise, a pig. They had a goat recently that was missing part of its skull that didn't form properly, and goats like to use their heads for stuff, obviously, so they made a helmet for him and one elephant leg recently. So, anyway, Cleo's scan: pretty straightforward, and within five minutes they have a couple decently accurate models to work with and then they import it into the computer. to move to step two, So how do you get the scan off the phone? - Well, that's the easy part. We get the scan off the phone onto our web portal, which we're able to bring into a custom design software. here, where that's really where the magic happens, where we're able to take a design and really mold it to the 3D scan of each pet so that we can make sure everything's fitting perfect -. So this is Cleo's scan and the appropriate fit as it would be built on the scan. - Right, so you can see the scan overlaid and we can patch things up as needed. It's almost like 3D Photoshop in a way, but then we're able to control the lattice, the hardware mounts, where the straps go. we can really position everything perfect to each pet. And then, once we're happy, once it's set, then we bring it into another software where this is where we optimize it for printing. So we have to be able to basically give the printer instruction on what to make. So this is where we really fine tune the intricacies and the detail of each layer, 'cause, again, we want some areas to be nice and rigid: where hardware mounts, for example. But like around the rib cage, around the lungs, we want the flexibility so you can see, we don't have that thick lattice there, This over here, these wings, we can really easily bend. even if the dog fluctuates in weight, we want it to accommodate those changes. But where the mount is, where the hardware is, on this end this, we want to be really sturdy and strong, 'cause that's where the impact is. So once we're happy with this, once it's ready to go, we'll take it over to one of the 3D printers- and we have a whole bunch of different sizes depending on the case, depending on the animal, but they're all pretty similar in how they work - So 3D printing. to be perfectly honest, I never really cared that much about 3D printing. This is like a confession, Like I never. There was a ton of hype about it and obviously a lot of people care a lot about it. but every time I was brought up to me I couldn't really find a reason to care and we got a 3D printer at the studio and we've printed a couple random trinkets here and there- mostly things that are just like useless stuff, just to see if it'll work. Whatever neat. but this is the first time I've seen a situation where 3D printing clearly makes the most sense for a manufacturing process. Obviously, you can't do one single mold, you can't do one size fits all. so, like I said, it just made the most sense. for once. They have a couple different size printers in here, ranging from something like an Anker M5, something you might buy on Amazon- all the way up to an industrial sized one the size of a refrigerator, basically to work on different sized pieces for different animals. So once they were happy with Cleo's design of the prosthesis in the software, it hits the printer and about literally 24 hours later it's done. it's printed the whole thing. Now this isn't the final step. for hers, There is still a sanding down process to soften the corners and make it as comfortable as possible, and also in 3D printing. there's commonly these support pieces that you get when you print oddly shaped objects that need to be cut off, and they're actually working on ways to melt that down and use it in other things like wheels or feet, so they can actually be resourceful about that as well. but they've showed me a bunch of examples of various shapes and sizes of things they've printed for animals in the past - So this one is just about ready to ship out. This dog has a residual limb, So we have this build out here and we do it like this so that we can keep the weight bearing load right below where the limb used to be. If we have it in any other place, they just won't be able to walk correctly - And this is also now softened down and it is just sanded basically - We do a sand and torch, So we'll basically burn the material back like what the machine is doing, heating it up to a melting temperature. it smooths it out, And something that we're very well known for with our devices are our feet, And so one of the biggest things is when the dogs are taking steps, you want that foot to be able to compress, to absorb that. I'll trade you. I think this is version like five or six of the foot and we're on version like 10 or 12 of the harness. so they're constantly changing and adapting. If somebody reaches out to us and they say I burned through a foot, here are the reasons why we're gonna make the changes to the foot so that stops happening And so that's why we go through our variations. We're actually working on the next version of the foot, which has rounder edges, so more of a radius on these edges - Like a tire maybe - Yeah, yeah, exactly like a tire, because dogs tend to lean on one side or the other and we'll typically have the owners flip it around once they start to wear on one side so it wears evenly. - A tire rotation - Exactly a foot rotation. And then behind you we have some of our carts that are in process too. So this is one going down to a dog in Texas. She's got two deformed limbs. In fact, one is really not formed at all, but she's got one deformed here on the left hand side. So we make provisions for that so that the shoulders can still move around. So this'll get three, six inch wheels on each corner. And then this: this is another good example, This is for a dachshund that has one full remaining leg and had a partial amputation, And so the owners didn't want something extremely bulky, but they wanted that front leg to have support, 'cause dachshunds have a lot of back problems. So we designed this specifically for this case, where the dachshund can put its legs and move it and still have the support on the outer edges and we still have our flexible harness here And the wheels can change camber as well too. so, depending on-- - Sport mode - And we'll go up to eight or 10 inch wheels. I think you saw this one - That Escalade dogs - We should do spinners on one of these rooms one of these days. honestly, I haven't put it past people. The woman that we did our original dachshund cart for. she saw our black wheels and she was like: I'd like silver rims please, and I thought she was joking. I totally thought she was joking and I was like, oh, that's a cool idea. She was like, no, really, I want silver wheels. - Would you paint it or would you-- - We ended up painting it. Yeah, yeah, yeah - So Cleo's scan was pretty good. Then they designed her prosthesis around that scan. that went great. Then they printed it, sanded it and torched it down and matched it with the leg for her height. The only step left now is to see how it works. So what I kind of didn't realize is it's not just like you attach the prosthesis to the dog and then they just magically start running around perfectly like they've had it their whole life. But no, like anyone who's had crutches knows this. there's actually an adjustment process as you get more and more used to it. So I got to watch Cleo sort of learn in real time, even in just these few minutes, go from hovering it off the ground to eventually starting to trust it. And the process of them getting used to it, depending on the pet, is basically to introduce them to more and more time per day with it so that they eventually get used to totally living with it. Maybe 20 minutes a day at the beginning, then it's an hour a day, then two hours a day, and you slowly see them start to remap their muscle memory and unlearn walking without the limb and really trust it and depend on it by the end. So at the end of the day I thought this was super cool and basically it's a huge win for pets like Cleo, and it's also super cool that it's enabled by tech that feels relatively accessible, like a phone in our pocket, a computer app, one or two pieces of software and then 3D printers, like all things that we can get started with. that's how they got started with building this studio in New Jersey and actually helping so many pets, and they actually now will continue to evolve this. There's other places around the country in the world doing the same sort of thing, but they potentially can do remote creations for pets that don't come to the studio, but they get to like send a mold in and then build a prosthesis for other animals they don't even get to see. I'm not even gonna pretend to be an expert on 3D printing or prosthesis, but like, hopefully this helps more animals, sort of extend their lives and live more freely, I think, is the right word. These pieces are typically priced from a couple 100 bucks to up to 1,000 or $2,000 and ideally will last a lifetime at least, if they've stopped growing. So thanks to 3D Pets for letting me pull back the curtain a little bit into how they use tech to do what they do, Thanks to Cleo for letting me hang out all day and thanks to you for watching.

two\n[Music]\n[Music]\nforeign\noh my god\noh wow wow I've never felt that in my\nface I think we can do it better I think\nwe can do it even better so let's do\nthat quarter mile straight line one more\ntime\nbut this time next to me is going to be\na very very fast car\nthe Porsche 911 Turbo S that car does 0\nto 60 in under two and a half seconds\nI'm gonna give that 640 horsepower\nall-wheel drive Porsche a two second\nHead Start\nin a 400 yard race now let's see what\nthis romance does to that very fast\nPorsche\n[Music]\nzero one two\n[Music]\ncrazy\n[Music]\nnothing is supposed to walk a car like\nthat I mean this car is fast but\nthere you have it this is a street legal\nelectric car after all though so uh\naround normal roads how does it drive so\nI'm driving in range mode right now\nwhich by default is a hundred percent\nfront axle power 30 rear axle and the\nsoftest suspension and the least\naggressive acceleration the brakes are\nstill really strong but honestly this is\na very compliant car that's one of these\nthings that I think is inherently going\nto be better about all these electric\nsupercars is they can be really really\nsoft and friendly despite having 2 000\nhorsepower available the second you want\nit as I'm looking at the top I have\nalmost 100 battery and about 100 miles\nof range estimated so I'm assuming it's\ngoing to tell me that my range is low\nbased on how I've driven in the past and\nthis car has not been babied so I guess\nI should shock me but we are working\nwith 120 kilowatt hour battery so pretty\nbig battery the quad Motors uh and it\nwill estimate\nsay about 300 miles of range on a full\ncharge which is pretty good it has that\nCCS cord right behind my head and it'll\ncharge from zero to eighty percent on a\nfast charger in 20 minutes and then this\nis also a really there's a funny\ncombination of parts I talk a little bit\nin the autofocus video about this car\nabout how they got bought by the\nVolkswagen group they got a bunch of\nmoney into this company and they're\nmerged with Bugatti now so it's Bugatti\nrematched and there's a lot to this car\nthat actually reminds me of Bugatti\nwhere they clearly could have been\nlighter uh but they didn't they went\nwith high quality stuff everywhere\nbasically everything in this car is\neither carbon fiber or metal and it is\nrock solid there's not a ton of uh\ndampening or like ice noise isolation or\nfoam or anything like that like I can\nhear the Rocks like going through the\nwheel well it feels like a relatively\nheavy but still compact sports car I\nkind of like it also one more thing I've\nnoticed uh so the dashboard of this car\nthe primary thing in the middle is the\nspeed and it actually changes the color\nbased on the mode you're in we'll get to\nthe modes but also my uh estimated range\nhas been going up as I've been driving\nso it knows I've been going slower Kudos\nbut also it shows my total power output\nand regen in a live counter on the side\nwhen I hit the brake pedal the regen\nnumber actually goes up so that means\nthey're adding regen before blending in\nthe friction breaks so it feels and\ndrives like a normal car it costs mostly\nwhen I let off the accelerator but it\nbehaves a lot like Porsche's taikan and\nthat same 800 volt system which means\nhitting the brakes starts with regen\nthen adds friction breaks it's clever\neven the infotainment is kind of\ninteresting it is a big touch screen in\nthe middle of a car interestingly with\nsome storage behind it that you could\njust pull back to reveal but there's a\nbunch of features there's a 360 camera\nthere's a map there's also a button on\nthe steering wheel that has a little\npicture of like a voice control when I\npress it it says this car is going to\nget voice commands and Apple carplay and\nAndroid auto with a software update if\nit actually does get all those things\nand it's wireless that would make this\none of the best car infotainment systems\nof any hyper car I've ever seen but as\nof right now it doesn't have that but\nyou can still connect your phone and\nplay Bluetooth music on the Focal\nSpeakers which are all over the cabin so\nI really think that in this transition\nor in this upcoming boost of all these\nelectric cars one of the most impressive\nthings about them is the Jekyll and Hyde\nFactor the fact that these cars can have\nmultiple personalities obviously it's\nsuper cool and super aggressive and\nsnarling to have a gas car that has a\nton of power and sounds amazing all the\ntime I'm surrounded by those cars right\nnow you can't even see but a really\nimpressive electric car can be both\nreally fast and performant\nand really soft and docile and smooth\nand I think this is one of those\nexamples where just driving it around\nlike normal feels really soft and smooth\nand if it goes into sport mode or Cruise\nmode or track mode well it sort of puts\na mask on so I had to look it up to\nremember which is which but the Dr\nJekyll guy the nice guy is just driving\nin range mode or Cruise mode all the\ngauges are blue and green and there's a\nsmooth soft throttle response soft\nsuspension lighter steering and the rear\nwing is all the way down at its lowest\nsetting just to glide through the air\nwith maximum efficiency and minimal drag\nit's almost shockingly calm you'd never\nknow about all the horsepower underneath\nyour foot but with the soft steering and\nthe regen braking it feels and drives\nI'm not even joking just like a super\nlow Tesla Model 3 with Incredible brakes\nbut the Mr Hyde is the evil one and in\nthis very same car just by turning the\nknobs and going into sport mode or track\nmode dialing up the power and everything\nturning yellow and red you tighten up\nthe steering you stiffen the suspension\nthe throttle response from the pedal\nbecomes much more linear with your foot\nlike it's incredibly reactive just\ntouching the pedal and the huge carbon\nfiber Wing extends up and out into the\nair completely nuking your rear\nvisibility to create more downforce to\nkeep you planted to the road along with\nan active rear splitter down underneath\nto redirect air\nplus if you're fast enough and hit the\nbrakes hard enough the wing will flip up\nand become an air brake to help you slow\ndown even faster this whole car\nbasically tightens up even more than it\nalready was around you and becomes a\nweapon of speed and precision I've never\nfelt a car where you have such direct\nand immediate control over exactly how\nfast you're going at any moment more\nthan the Plaid Model S more than any gas\ncar I've ever tried the lag is just\nnon-existent it's pretty incredible so\nanyway I guess the point is this is\nstill that moment that we are waiting\nfor for electric cars even if it didn't\ncome from Tesla all those records that I\nwas talking to you about before those\nweren't electric car records those were\nproduction car world records everything\nthis does in a straight line is faster\nthan the Bugatti Chiron now I feel like\nthe number one comment I can already see\nbelow this video is oh but I'd rather\ntake the shear on I'd rather take any of\nthe gas cars any day because of the\nnoise and the soul and the fun of it and\nI get that to an extent obviously see a\ntwo million dollar exotic

surprise off the back of a truck and it was the Roadster 2.0, a two-door electric sports car- I should say Supercar- with absurd specs, world record acceleration, just filthy numbers. this would be the flagship Smackdown to all gas cars, as it was promised. but since then they've had a little bit of a re-shuffling of their priorities. you could say they've got a whole cyber truck they're trying to make now other stuff they're going to mass produce. so I guess what I'm trying to say is that Roadster is indefinitely delayed, which is a bit of a bummer, so I guess the smackdown's gonna have to wait. actually wait, hold on hold. that thought foreign [Music] Avera, and it is absolutely the smackdown of gasoline cars that we knew was eventually coming. you've been able to buy one million, two million, three million dollar gas supercars for years now, but electric cars are, of course, newer and they're exploding onto the scene. so now we get to see what an all-out, technologically advanced, maximum performance, all-electric hyper car actually looks like and feels like romance has made one car before the rematch concept one. I was actually lucky enough to test that car too. that tiny little thing. they only made eight copies of that. then they started working on the romance concept 2, as they got acquired by Volkswagen group and merged with Bugatti, so that concept, too, became this Nevada, which they'll only make 150 of and will cost 2.4 million dollars. so so, to be fair, this isn't a completely different Stratosphere than the promise Tesla Roadster, but the idea for all of them is the same: just make the fastest car possible, and so, of course, it's electric. you know those like Scale of the Universe videos on YouTube, where the numbers you see, you see the scale of things get bigger and bigger, until the numbers just don't even make sense anymore and they're not comprehensible by the human brain. that's this car: zero to 60 miles an hour: 1.74 seconds- world record. zero to a hundred miles an hour in 3.2 seconds. world record. quarter mile: 8.3 seconds world record. zero to 200 miles an hour in 10 seconds. world record. zero to 250 to zero: in under 30 seconds- world record. there's there's 23 World Records on this list, and one of them is the record for most records broken in a day. these numbers don't really make any sense, so I need to feel this for myself. so, uh, track mode: the wing pops up, everything turns red. 100 front power, 100 rear power. put on the brake, put on the gas, three, two [Music]. [Music] foreign. oh my god, oh, wow, wow. I've never felt that in my face. I think we can do it better. I think we can do it even better. so let's do that quarter mile straight line one more time, but this time next to me is going to be a very, very fast car: the Porsche 911 Turbo S. that car does 0 to 60 in under two and a half seconds. I'm gonna give that 640 horsepower all-wheel drive Porsche a two second Head Start in a 400 yard race. now let's see what this romance does to that. very fast Porsche. [Music] zero, one, two [Music] crazy [Music]. nothing is supposed to walk a car like that. I mean, this car is fast, but there you have it. this is a street legal electric car, after all, though, so uh, around normal roads, how does it drive? so I'm driving in range mode right now, which, by default, is a hundred percent front axle power, 30 rear axle and the softest suspension and the least aggressive acceleration. the brakes are still really strong, but honestly, this is a very compliant car. that's one of these things that I think is inherently going to be better about all these electric supercars is they can be really, really soft and friendly despite having 2 000 horsepower available. the second you want it. as I'm looking at the top, I have almost 100 battery and about 100 miles of range estimated. so I'm assuming it's going to tell me that my range is low based on how I've driven in the past and this car has not been babied, so I guess I should shock me. but we are working with 120 kilowatt hour battery, so pretty big battery. the quad Motors, uh, and it will estimate, say, about 300 miles of range on a full charge, which is pretty good. it has that CCS cord right behind my head and it'll charge from zero to eighty percent on a fast charger in 20 minutes. and then this is also a really there's a funny combination of parts. I talk a little bit in the autofocus video about this car, about how they got bought by the Volkswagen group. they got a bunch of money into this company and they're merged with Bugatti now, so it's Bugatti rematched and there's a lot to this car that actually reminds me of Bugatti, where they clearly could have been lighter, uh, but they didn't. they went with high quality stuff everywhere. basically everything in this car is either carbon fiber or metal and it is rock solid. there's not a ton of uh dampening or like ice, noise isolation or foam or anything like that. like I can hear the Rocks like going through the wheel. well, it feels like a relatively heavy but still compact sports car. I kind of like it. also one more thing I've noticed: uh, so the dashboard of this car. the primary thing in the middle is the speed and it actually changes the color based on the mode you're in. we'll get to the modes. but also my uh estimated range has been going up as I've been driving, so it knows I've been going slower, Kudos. but also it shows my total power output and regen in a live counter on the side. when I hit the brake pedal the regen number actually goes up. so that means they're adding regen before blending in the friction breaks. so it feels and drives like a normal car. it costs mostly when I let off the accelerator. but it behaves a lot like Porsche's taikan and that same 800 volt system which means hitting the brakes starts with regen, then adds friction breaks. it's clever. even the infotainment is kind of interesting. it is a big touch screen in the middle of a car, interestingly with some storage behind it that you could just pull back to reveal. but there's a bunch of features. there's a 360 camera, there's a map. there's also a button on the steering wheel that has a little picture of like a voice control. when I press it it says this car is going to get voice commands and Apple carplay and Android auto with a software update. if it actually does get all those things and it's wireless, that would make this one of the best car infotainment systems of any hyper car I've ever seen. but as of right now it doesn't have that. but you can still connect your phone and play Bluetooth music on the Focal Speakers which are all over the cabin. so I really think that in this transition or in this upcoming boost of all these electric cars, one of the most impressive things about them is the Jekyll and Hyde Factor, the fact that these cars can have multiple personalities. obviously it's super cool and super aggressive and snarling to have a gas car that has a ton of power and sounds amazing. all the time I'm surrounded by those cars right now you can't even see. but a really impressive electric car can be both really fast and performant and really soft and docile and smooth and I think this is one of those examples where just driving it around like normal feels really soft and smooth. and if it goes into sport mode or Cruise mode or track mode, well it sort of puts a mask on. so I had to look it up to remember which is which. but the Dr Jekyll guy, the nice guy, is just driving in range mode or Cruise mode, all the gauges are blue and green and there's a smooth, soft throttle response, soft suspension, lighter steering and the rear wing is all the way down at its lowest setting just to glide through the air with maximum efficiency and minimal drag. it's almost shockingly calm. you'd never know about all the horsepower underneath your foot, but with the soft steering and the regen braking it feels and drives- I'm not even joking- just like a super low Tesla Model 3 with Incredible brakes. but the Mr Hyde is the evil one. and in this very same car, just by turning the knobs and going into sport mode or track mode, dialing up the power and everything turning yellow and red, you tighten up the steering, you stiffen the suspension. the throttle response from the pedal becomes much more linear, with your foot like it's incredibly reactive, just touching the pedal and the huge carbon fiber Wing extends up and out into the air, completely nuking your rear visibility to create more downforce to keep you planted to the road, along with an active rear splitter down underneath to redirect air. plus, if you're fast enough and hit the brakes hard enough, the wing will flip up and become an air brake to help you slow down even faster. this whole car basically tightens up even more than it already was around you and becomes a weapon of speed and precision. I've never felt a car where you have such direct and immediate control over exactly how fast you're going at any moment. more than the Plaid Model S, more than any gas car I've ever tried. the lag is just non-existent. it's pretty incredible. so anyway, I guess the point is, this is still that moment that we are waiting for for electric cars, even if it didn't come from Tesla. all those records that I was talking to you about before, those weren't electric car records, those were production car world records. everything this does in a straight line is faster than the Bugatti Chiron. now I feel like the number one comment I can already see below this video is: oh, but I'd rather take the shear on, I'd rather take any of the gas cars any day because of the noise and the soul and the fun of it, and I get that to an extent. obviously. see a two million dollar exotic hyper car should have fun. it's way more about fun than practicality, so I understand that. but the point is, the future of cars is now proven to be electrified in some way. the newest Corvette Flagship is electrified, the newest Lamborghini Flagship is electrified. the newest Ferrari Flagship is electrified. the newest Bugatti coming up will be electrified. the new McLaren Flagship to replace the P1 will be electrified, and that's what we've learned. so in the meantime, it was exciting getting to drive this one of 150 super rare, expensive car. shout out to the triple F collection for letting me come out here and actually beat on this car and really drive it. it was incredible. check out their channel for more races with this car and other exotic cars. also, go check out the studio Channel if you want to see a whole bunch of people at the studio. not only help shoot this video, but also experience the ridiculous acceleration. also the autofocus channel for all the other car stuff. I think that's it okay. speed is ruined for me forever. thanks for watching. peace, foreign."}, {"title": "Samsung Tab S9 Ultra: Is the iPad Killer Real?", "description": "The megatablet is back, with

every single\ntime people get really into them and I'm\nreally into them but the question that\nalways keeps coming up every time is\nare these actually iPad Killers like is\nan iPad killer a real thing\nso let's talk about it\nthis is the newest highest end Android\nTablet from Samsung the Galaxy Tab S9\nUltra and it's even more ridiculous than\nthe previous year's already crazy Ultra\nand I love it so I've already made a\nvideo on the tab S7 plus and then last\nyear the tab S8 Ultra if you haven't\nalready seen that I'll link it below\nthat was last year's version and so now\njust like the rest of Samsung's recent\nannouncements this new one mostly looks\nthe same as last year's version but all\nthe changes they've made are in the same\ndirection just making it even more\ncapable so you've got this gigantic 14.6\ninch tablet that I mean it feels like\nI'm holding a small TV in my hands it\nsomehow also razor thin with a huge\nbattery inside and it actually doesn't\nsnap in half despite looking like it\nprobably should be susceptible to that\nbut hey watch The X video for yourself\nif you don't believe me it survives\nbetter than a lot of other devices have\nthis year though a new Snapdragon 8 Gen\n2 for Galaxy inside plus a new Vapor\nchamber cooling system under the hood so\nthere's going to be an even higher\nceiling for performance for everything\nit's already good at we've seen this\nthing do multitasking well for years and\nbe quick to scroll around and open and\nclose apps with normal usage and now\nit'll do better at gaming and video\nediting and potentially also last a bit\nlonger on that same 11 200 milliamp hour\nbattery that's bigger than any battery\nthat's ever been in an iPad this year\nthe quad speaker setup is also now made\nup of 20 larger speakers which is a\npretty big jump and I'm not ready to\ncall these the best sounding speakers in\nany tablet quite yet that's still that\ngoes to the iPad Pro still but these\nsure do get really loud with very little\nDistortion and you can flip on Dolby\nAtmos audio if you want some pretty\nimpressive surround sound effects for\nmusic or videos or games and then this\nentire tablet is now ip68 water and dust\nresistant for the first time which means\nit's safe to not just splash it with\nwater but literally completely submerge\nthe whole thing underwater and it'll be\ntotally fine which is crazy I don't know\nany situation where you would end up\nwith a tablet underwater maybe you're\nrecklessly watching Netflix next to a\npool or something and then you drop it\nin I don't know that but if you did\nit will still be fine but then on top of\nthat this S Pen also comes in the Box\nagain and this thing also now has an\nip68 rating of its own and it also now\nsupports bi-directional charging but not\nthe bi-directional charging you're\nprobably thinking of when you can accept\ncharge from the tablet but also charge\nother things no I just mean whatever\nDirection the pen faces when you\nmagnetize it to the back of the tablet\nit will work and charge perfectly fine\nwhich is better than last year what I'm\nsurprised doesn't come in the box is any\ncharging brick I mean for a tablet that\ndoes everything this thing is actually\ncapable of 45 watt charging which is\nreally solid but the only way to get\nthat is to buy a charger something like\nthis anchor Prime desktop charger which\nI would totally get over any Samsung\nfirst party charger because it's gallium\nnitride it's smaller and then it also\nhas multi-port charging up to 240 Watts\nMax output so you could literally charge\na laptop full speed and the tablet full\nspeed at the same time but then of\ncourse they also make a really\nconvenient battery Bank option so this\nthis is the anchor Prime 250 watt\nbattery bank with two USBC ports and one\nUSB a port it has a built-in inductive\nwireless charging pad so that can charge\nthe battery Bank up to 100 watts and\nthen there's an app connected to it that\nlets you configure the display and\noptimize charging or even play a sound\nto find it it's way more advanced than\nany charger that's ever come in any\nSamsung bucks so shout out to anchor for\nsponsoring this video and I'll put a\nlink in the description for you to check\nthis one out right below that like\nbutton but the point is I mean you've\nseen all the specs now they're all huge\nnumbers it's a 14 and a half inch screen\nin my hands it's 120 hertz it's an 11\n200 milliamp hour battery it's quad\nspeakers it's the minimum 12 gigs of RAM\nit's a terabyte of internal storage with\nup to another terabyte of micro SD card\nstorage all these numbers are great but\nit's actually using this tablet and\nactually holding it it's it's hard to\ndescribe it to you but it's even more\nhilariously fun so I'm personally\npartial to like media idea consumption\non devices like this like I would just\nwant to watch YouTube videos on a\ngigantic screen take them with me\ndownload them offline watch them on\nflights with my free time like it's\nalready amazing for that and honestly I\nthink that's what most people do on\ntablets a lot of the time but of course\nfor all the additional stuff that tablet\npower users are going to be doing there\nis just so much more that this thing is\ncapable of basically it's at the\nForefront of tablets there's all of\nSamsung's multi-window multitasking\nfeatures and pop-up windows on that\n16x10 aspect ratio display all of the\nstylus features which if you want to use\na stylus on a tablet it feels like\nSamsung and Apple are really the only\nones taking it seriously but you know\nI'm using it to sign documents every\nonce in a while but there are some\npeople whose entire workflows go through\nthis thing and then you can't forget\nabout decks there's a whole clever\nkeyboard folio case that I didn't even\nhave here for this one but I had it for\nthe S8 Ultra and that adds a whole\nnother Dimension and Dex mode has been\nsuper used useful while giving you that\ndesktop experience with independent\nwindows and you can plug it into an even\nlarger display if you want to it's more\npowerful than anything Apple has even\ntried to do on the iPad and all of that\nisn't even mentioning that this is\nprobably the biggest camera viewfinder\nanyone has ever used Plus on the front\nthat little Notch up there I've\nmentioned this before but there's two\nselfie cameras a front-facing normal\ncamera and an ultra wide that can do\nauto framing in videos or in video calls\nsimilar to what Apple calls Center Stage\nexcept these cameras are actually in the\nright place on the long side of the\ntablet so all that being said can this\nbe an iPad killer\nthat's the question we keep asking and\nit's a good it's a real question like\nthis is clearly competing against the\niPad Pro the biggest baddest iPad Pro\nbut it's going to have a lot of things a\nlot of features a lot of numbers to\none-up the iPad Pro right it's got a\nbigger screen it's got bigger speakers\nit's got external expandable storage\nit's got the fingerprint reader that the\niPad Pro doesn't have and all of that\ncosts a hundred dollars more than the\nequivalent iPad Pro\nthis reminds me of the conversation\nwe've had about Sony phones like in the\nworld of Android phones Sony is out here\nmaking incredibly well-equipped super\nhigh-end phones with a ton of Enthusiast\nfeatures and expandable memory and\nmanual controls that the competition\nlike just straight up doesn't offer and\nthat's only really at the expense of a\nlittle bit of automatic mode usability\nand price like they just they're\nexpensive they cost more and while it's\nreally easy to point out all the obvious\nbenefits and advantages to all these\nextra features and these cool things\nthat it does it turns out\nthat the number of people who will\nactually take advantage of these\nfeatures is Tiny\nand I mean they're everywhere on YouTube\nbut when it comes to actually voting\nwith their wallets most people end up\njust going with the sort of more\nstandard one and I feel like there is a\nsimilar phenomenon Happening Here\nfor whatever reason videos about these\ntablets do numbers they're they're going\ncrazy like people love to see these on\nvideo and I like talking about them but\nthen when it comes to actually buying\nthem\npeople uh the the ecosystem effect is\nway stronger than any uh YouTube\ncomments would suggest people love\nflocking to the iPad for iMessage and\nFaceTime and all these other things but\nto keep it even more simple I like I\nhave this analogy that I really like\neven better\npeople like bigger screens as long as it\ndoesn't sacrifice too much in the other\nareas of the device\nso take the MacBook Air for example that\n13-inch MacBook Air was one of the best\nselling laptops for years it was Apple's\nnumber one best-selling laptop for a\nlong time and people wanted a bigger\nscreen but the only way that they could\nget a bigger screen and still buy an\nApple product was to move all the way up\nto the 16-inch MacBook Pro which was\njust dramatically more expensive I mean\nit was Overkill most people did not need\nthat much computer and so people would\nactually start to drift away and go buy\na different slightly bigger screened\nlaptop from some other company so much\nso that Apple finally this year decided\nto introduce a larger 15-inch MacBook\nAir and it turned out that's exactly\nwhat people wanted they just want the\nbigger screen on the other end of this\napple tried introducing a mini iPhone\nfor two whole years which you would\nthink is a brilliant idea if you only\nread YouTube comments but again it turns\nout most people\nwant the bigger screen and so that ended\nup not selling enough it got\ndiscontinued and today we have a plus\nphone instead so this is a bigger screen\ntablet than the iPad Pro which is why\nit's so amazing and impressive to hold\nand look at\nbut it's also a very different tablet\nfrom the iPad Pro it's 100 bucks more\nbut it's an Android tablet it has a\nwhole different feature set and for a\nlot of people that's too much sacrifice\nand a lot of people will continue to\njust get iPads but for those who are not\nlooped into the ecosystem and who don't\ndepend on these features\nthis is a hell of a tablet\nthanks for watching\ncatch you in the next one peace\n", "punctuated_text": "okay. so I've made a short on this and I've made videos about these Monster tablets in the past, and every single time people get really into them, and I'm really into them. but the question that always keeps coming up every time is: are these actually iPad Killers? like, is an iPad killer a real thing? so let's talk about it. this is the newest highest end Android Tablet from Samsung- the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, and it's even more ridiculous than the previous year's already crazy Ultra and I love it. so I've already made a video on the tab S7 plus and then last year, the tab S8 Ultra. if you haven't already seen that, I'll link it below. that was last year's version, and so now, just like the rest of Samsung's recent announcements, this new one mostly looks the same as last year's version, but all the changes they've made are in the same direction, just making it even more capable. so you've got this gigantic 14.6 inch tablet that I mean. it feels like I'm holding a small TV in my hands. it somehow also razor thin, with a huge battery inside, and it actually doesn't snap in half, despite looking like it probably should be susceptible to that. but hey, watch The X video for yourself if you don't believe me. it survives better than a lot of other devices have. this year, though, a new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy inside, plus a new Vapor chamber cooling system under the hood, so there's going to be an even higher ceiling for performance for everything it's already good at. we've seen this thing do multitasking well for years and be quick to scroll around and open and close apps with normal usage, and now it'll do better at gaming and video editing and potentially also last a bit longer on that same 11 200 milliamp hour battery. that's bigger than any battery that's ever been in an iPad. this year, the quad speaker setup is also now made up of 20 larger speakers, which is a pretty big jump, and I'm not ready to call these the best sounding speakers in any tablet quite yet. that's still. that goes to the iPad Pro still, but these sure do get really loud with very little Distortion, and you can flip on Dolby Atmos audio if you want some pretty impressive surround sound effects for music or videos or games. and then this entire tablet is now ip68 water and dust resistant for the first time, which means it's safe to not just splash it with water but literally completely submerge the whole thing underwater and it'll be totally fine, which is crazy. I don't know any situation where you would end up with a tablet underwater. maybe you're recklessly watching Netflix next to a pool or something and then you drop it in. I don't know that. but if you did, it will still be fine. but then, on top of that, this S Pen also comes in the Box again, and this thing also now has an ip68 rating of its own and it also now supports bi-directional charging, but not the bi-directional charging you're probably thinking of, when you can accept charge from the tablet but also charge other things. no, I just mean whatever Direction the pen faces, when you magnetize it to the back of the tablet, it will work and charge perfectly fine, which is better than last year. what I'm surprised doesn't come in the box is any charging brick. I mean for a tablet that does everything. this thing is actually capable of 45 watt charging, which is really solid. but the only way to get that is to buy a charger, something like this anchor Prime desktop charger, which I would totally get over any Samsung first party charger, because it's gallium nitride, it's smaller and then it also has multi-port charging up to 240 Watts Max output, so you could literally charge a laptop full speed and the tablet full speed at the same time. but then, of course, they also make a really convenient battery Bank option. so this- this is the anchor Prime 250 watt battery bank with two USBC ports and one USB a port. it has a built-in inductive wireless charging pad so that can charge the battery Bank up to 100 watts, and then there's an app connected to it that lets you configure the display and optimize charging or even play a sound. to find it. it's way more advanced than any charger that's ever come in any Samsung bucks. so shout out to anchor for sponsoring this video, and I'll put a link in the description for you to check this one out, right below that like button. but the point is, I mean, you've seen all the specs now. they're all huge numbers. it's a 14 and a half inch screen in my hands, it's 120 hertz, it's an 11 200 milliamp hour battery, it's quad speakers, it's the minimum 12 gigs of RAM, it's a terabyte of internal storage with up to another terabyte of micro SD card storage. all these numbers are great. but it's actually using this tablet and actually holding it. it's. it's hard to describe it to you, but it's even more hilariously fun. so I'm personally partial to like media idea consumption on devices like this. like I would just want to watch YouTube videos on a gigantic screen, take them with me, download them offline, watch them on flights with my free time- like it's already amazing for that and honestly I think that's what most people do on tablets a lot of the time. but of course, for all the additional stuff that tablet power users are going to be doing, there is just so much more that this thing is capable of. basically, it's at the Forefront of tablets. there's all of Samsung's multi-window, multitasking features and pop-up windows on that 16x10 aspect ratio display. all of the stylus features, which, if you want to use a stylus on a tablet, it feels like Samsung and Apple are really the only ones taking it seriously. but you know I'm using it to sign documents every once in a while, but there are some people whose entire workflows go through this thing. and then you can't forget about decks. there's a whole clever keyboard folio case that I didn't even have here for this one, but I had it for the S8 Ultra and that adds a whole nother Dimension and Dex mode has been super used, useful, while giving you that desktop experience with independent windows, and you can plug it into an even larger display if you want to. it's more powerful than anything Apple has even tried to do on the iPad. and all of that isn't even mentioning that this is probably the biggest camera viewfinder anyone has ever used. Plus on the front- that little Notch up there- I've mentioned this before- but there's two selfie cameras: a front-facing normal camera and an ultra wide that can do auto framing in videos or in video calls, similar to what Apple calls Center Stage, except these cameras are actually in the right place on the long side of the tablet. so, all that being said, can this be an iPad killer? that's the question we keep asking, and it's a good, it's a real question like this- is clearly competing against the iPad Pro- the biggest, baddest iPad Pro, but it's going to have a lot of things, a lot of features, a lot of numbers to one-up. the iPad Pro- right, it's got a bigger screen, it's got bigger speakers, it's got external expandable storage, it's got the fingerprint reader that the iPad Pro doesn't have, and all of that costs a hundred dollars more than the equivalent iPad Pro. this reminds me of the conversation we've had about Sony phones, like in the world of Android phones. Sony is out here making incredibly well-equipped, super high-end phones with a ton of Enthusiast features and expandable memory and manual controls that the competition, like just straight up, doesn't offer, and that's only really at the expense of a little bit of automatic mode, usability and price like they just they're expensive, they cost more, and while it's really easy to point out all the obvious benefits and advantages to all these extra features and these cool things that it does, it turns out that the number of people who will actually take advantage of these features is Tiny, and I mean they're everywhere on YouTube, but when it comes to actually voting with their wallets, most people end up just going with the sort of more standard one, and I feel like there is a similar phenomenon Happening Here. for whatever reason, videos about these tablets do numbers. they're, they're going crazy like. people love to see these on video and I like talking about them, but then, when it comes to actually buying them, people uh the- the ecosystem effect is way stronger than any, uh, YouTube comments would suggest. people love flocking to the iPad for iMessage and FaceTime and all these other things. but to keep it even more simple, I like I have this analogy that I really like. even better, people like bigger screens as long as it doesn't sacrifice too much in the other areas of the device. so take the MacBook Air, for example. that 13-inch MacBook Air was one of the best selling laptops for years. it was Apple's number one best-selling laptop for a long time, and people wanted a bigger screen. but the only way that they could get a bigger screen and still buy an Apple product was to move all the way up to the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which was just dramatically more expensive. I mean, it was Overkill. most people did not need that much computer, and so people would actually start to drift away and go buy a different, slightly bigger screened laptop from some other company. so much so that Apple finally this year decided to introduce a larger, 15-inch MacBook Air, and it turned out that's exactly what people wanted. they just want the bigger screen. on the other end of this, apple tried introducing a mini iPhone for two whole years, which you would think is a brilliant idea if you only read YouTube comments. but again it turns out most people want the bigger screen, and so that ended up not selling enough. it got discontinued, and today we have a plus phone instead. so this is a bigger screen tablet than the iPad Pro, which is why it's so amazing and impressive to hold and look at, but it's also a very different tablet from the iPad Pro. it's 100 bucks more, but it's an Android tablet. it has a whole different feature set and for a lot of people that's too much sacrifice and a lot of people will continue to just get iPads. but for those who are not looped into the ecosystem and who don't depend on these features, this is a hell of a tablet. thanks for

"start": 630.24, "duration": 3.8}], "text": "all right so\nI was wrong about the Z flip 5.\nkinda\nkinda\nall right so this is the new z-flip 5\nfrom Samsung this is their smaller\nfolding phone again starting at a\nthousand bucks and in nearly the same\ndimensions as last year's four and I\nremember when it first got announced we\nhad some well-respected reviewers saying\nthis changes everything this is the big\nupgrade it's the biggest upgrade ever\nand my impression was they've settled\nhere now to be fair my video was\nexamining both the flip 5 and the fold\nfive and looking at how much like the\nfoldables world has evolved in the past\nyear and how much Samsung seems to be\nsticking to their tried and true form\nfactors so it just feels like they're\nrefining and settling into their\npositions but now after using the flip 5\nmuch more over the past couple days I\ngotta say I was wrong about this phone\nuh this is actually one of the biggest\nupdates yet so basically there's three\nmain new differences with this phone\nover the Z flip 4 which are the chip the\nhinge and then the new outside display\nand I'm gonna go in order of importance\nhere actually because I think it's a\npretty clear order so first of all well\nthey got this new overclocked Snapdragon\n8 Gen 2 chip in here great it's now up\nto date with the latest flagships it's\nthe same one that's in the s23 and s23\nUltra and yeah it's been a great chip\nyou know the phone is super responsive\nit can handle multitasking since it's\npaid with eight gigs of RAM it's Snappy\napps open quickly there's no issues here\nit can also handle heavy gaming and I\ndon't even gain much on my phone but it\ncan do it it's great the other half of a\ngreat ship though is efficiency so when\nI saw Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy I\nwas hoping to see maybe an improvement\nin overall battery life\nbut I didn't and I mean I guess I\nshouldn't be surprised considering the\nphysical battery size is still the same\nit's still 3 700 milliamp hours but it's\ngot way more pixels now to power which\nwe'll talk about that in a second so the\nnew chip fine but y'all have heard me\ntalk about the hinge though the hinge\nbeing the most important physical part\nof a folding phone you can't Ace a\nfolding phone without acing the hinge\nand this hinge is nice so Samsung for\nthe first time has actually taken Parts\nout of and simplified the hinge of this\nphone which has resulted in less moving\nParts which is typically a win for\nlong-term durability but also means a\nlittle less volume and a little less\nthickness around the back of the phone\nshout out to dave2d for this graphic\nbasically illustrating the new internal\nmulti-axis folding mechanism that allows\nthe OLED inside to have this slightly\ngentler wider radius when it's folded up\nwhich should put less stress through the\nmiddle honestly I don't notice a huge\ndifference with the crease it's still\nclearly there like it's one of those\nthings where you turn the screen off or\nlook off axis and it's very obvious but\nonce you get into the flow of using the\nphone it's very easy to forget about\nhonestly the most important difference\nhere with the hinge is actually just\nthat it folds completely flat now so\nevery z-flip up to this point has folded\nshut with just like a little small Gap\nthat could get you know a little bit of\ndust a little bit of sand a little bit\nof dirt inside which is not great when\nthe inside screen is the most delicate\npart of the phone so now all these\nfolding phones across the board from\neverybody they're all working towards\nthis gapless close it's still\ntechnically not fully dust resistant I\nmean it has an ipx8 rating again the 8\nmeans it can be splashed but the X means\nno official dust resistance yet but it's\nalso an even more satisfying clap now\nand yeah it's also just it's slightly\nmore firm it's a nice sturdy hinge every\nyear which is hard to appreciate until\nyou go back to the earliest folding\nphones and see how loose those were I\nstill personally hardly ever use those\nlike half folded features where you can\nlike prop it up and use the camera like\nthis or like watch videos or whatever\nbut look a good hinge is a good hinge\nbut the biggest change to this phone is\nclearly the bigger screen on the outside\nso let's talk about it so the z-flip has\ngone from this tiny little 1.9 inch slot\nto a full squared 3.4 inch 720p cover\nscreen called the flex window this is\nhuge it's a massive Improvement that's\nway more screen for checking the time or\nreading notifications way more screen\nfor framing up pictures with the primary\ncameras on the outside it's a huge win\nfor all that stuff and then also sends\nus this huge new screen they've sort of\norganized this UI of up to 11 pages of\napps that you can flip through uh sort\nof encouraging you to use the outside\nscreen more you're using a phone without\neven opening it so you can fully unlock\nand then just start swiping over to\neither quickly View and organize your\nnotifications or move between all these\nfull screen widgets I have a calendar\nwidget of course which is scrollable\nyou've got a scrollable weather widget\nbasically these are all not even really\nwidgets they're more like mini apps that\nhave been specifically Built For This\noutside screen to be fully functional\nand optimized and then it if you're\nfeeling bold you can also jump into the\nlab settings and start enabling other\nnon-optimized apps to also work on the\noutside screen so there's no question\nyou can do way more with this outside\nscreen than you ever could before on the\nflip the question that's up to you now\nreally is just will you actually use it\nlike how will you use it and it's a\nsurprisingly hard question to answer\nlike when I first saw the phone get\nreleased you know at first you see that\ngets a bigger outside screen but I\nhonestly thought I wouldn't use it much\nlike I thought I would just continue to\nuse the phone mostly open and I would\nenjoy the barrier between me and endless\nDoom scrolling and maybe I'd check the\ntime or some notifications a little bit\nmore on the outside\nbut I was wrong basically the thing that\nI found I do much more often especially\nlike early in the day is notification\nmanagement just triaging going through\nat the beginning through a bunch of\nnotifications and clearing through the\nones I don't need reading the ones that\nI do need to see that's way better than\nopening the phone and like accidentally\nstarting to Doom scroll through Tick\nTock or something so in the lab settings\nthere's basically only a few apps that\nyou can actually officially enable on\nthe outside screen it's basically Maps\nmessaging apps and then Netflix and\nYouTube for some reason for you psychos\nout there I definitely tried to answer\nsome texts with the full qwerty keyboard\nthat shows up on the outside screen now\nand yeah it technically works but it's\nlike all right do we really want to be\ndoing this like my hands are too big to\nbe typing on this small of a keyboard\nregularly maybe a few quick responses to\nstuff here and there maybe voice to text\na little more often but nothing too\ncrazy there's actually also even a whole\napp in the Samsung Galaxy store called\ngood luck with an extension called\nmulti-star and basically if you have\nboth of these it lets you add a launcher\nto the outside screen with literally any\napp on your phone and so you can go\nthrough and experiment and find all\nkinds of weird stuff that kind of works\nhere like you can technically just\nscroll through Twitter through X if you\nwant to you can flip through your\nfavorite Reddit app before it disappears\nor you can move around Spotify playlists\nand these are all kind of not bad\nthere are also plenty of apps that are\nan absolute nightmare that look\nridiculous in a square so I wouldn't\nrecommend that but I still feel like the\nwhole point of having a flipping phone\nRemains the Same like I this barrier\nbetween open and and shut like it's nice\nto have the outside functionality but\nthis action really signifies okay now\nI'm about to get in and like actually do\nsomething on my phone it just really\nbecomes up to you where that line is of\nlike when do you open it versus when you\ndo something on the outside and I think\nthat my theory is it's just time it's\njust how long does that action take so\nif it's just checking your notifications\nor just reading the time or something\nquick like that or pausing your music\nthat takes two seconds green light like\nthat could be on the outside screen but\nwatching a two-hour Netflix documentary\nor something that takes like writing an\nemail you don't want to do that on the\noutside screen that's that's a red light\nand then there's a whole bunch of stuff\nkind of somewhere in the middle like\nflipping through a new playlist in\nSpotify maybe or\nchecking your calendar or just like\nlittle brief stuff\nthat's up to you so yeah if I could give\nSamsung any feedback on this thing that\nthey've made here I mean I think they\nwill continue to settle into this\nGeneral shape I think they're pretty\nlocked in with it but two things one the\noutside screen is 720p and if you look\nclosely enough you can see some pixels\nso maybe a little resolution bump would\nbe nice but I think more importantly\nactually is ltpo this is a 60 hertz\noutside screen so it's 60 hertz all the\ntime and I think if you had an ltpo\nscreen first of all it would match the\n120 hertz Max refresh of the inside\nwhich it's not the end of the world that\nthey're different but also that could\nsave battery life being able to go down\nto one Hertz when you're only just like\nplay pausing music or reading a quick\nnotification or something that could\nhelp with the relatively small batteries\non these phones oh and uh\nmaybe add decks\nthat would be kind of nice too so all\nright at the end of the day should you\nbuy the z-flip 5. honestly the truth is\nthat I think this is the best folding\nphone on the planet

video about the iPhone of\nAndroid I'll link that below if you want\nto check that out too but either way\nthat's been it thanks for watching\ncatch you in the next one peace\n", "punctuated_text": "all right. so I was wrong about the Z flip 5.. kinda, kinda all right. so this is the new z-flip 5 from Samsung. this is their smaller folding phone, again starting at a thousand bucks and in nearly the same dimensions as last year's four, and I remember when it first got announced we had some well-respected reviewers saying: this changes everything. this is the big upgrade. it's the biggest upgrade ever, and my impression was they've settled here now. to be fair, my video was examining both the flip 5 and the fold five and looking at how much like the foldables world has evolved in the past year and how much Samsung seems to be sticking to their tried and true form factors. so it just feels like they're refining and settling into their positions. but now, after using the flip 5 much more over the past couple days, I gotta say I was wrong about this phone. uh, this is actually one of the biggest updates yet. so basically, there's three main new differences with this phone over the Z flip 4, which are the chip, the hinge and then the new outside display, and I'm gonna go in order of importance here, actually, because I think it's a pretty clear order. so first of all, well, they got this new overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip in here. great, it's now up to date with the latest flagships. it's the same one that's in the s23 and s23 Ultra, and, yeah, it's been a great chip. you know the phone is super responsive. it can handle multitasking. since it's paid with eight gigs of RAM, it's Snappy apps open quickly, there's no issues here. it can also handle heavy gaming, and I don't even gain much on my phone, but it can do it, it's great. the other half of a great ship, though, is efficiency. so when I saw Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, I was hoping to see maybe an improvement in overall battery life, but I didn't, and I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, considering the physical battery size is still the same- it's still 3 700 milliamp hours, but it's got way more pixels. now to power, which we'll talk about that in a second. so the new chip: fine, but y'all have heard me talk about the hinge, though, the hinge being the most important physical part of a folding phone. you can't Ace a folding phone without acing the hinge, and this hinge is nice. so Samsung, for the first time, has actually taken Parts out of and simplified the hinge of this phone, which has resulted in less moving Parts, which is typically a win for long-term durability, but also means a little less volume and a little less thickness around the back of the phone. shout out to dave2d for this graphic basically illustrating the new internal multi-axis folding mechanism that allows the OLED inside to have this slightly gentler, wider radius when it's folded up, which should put less stress through the middle. honestly, I don't notice a huge difference with the crease. it's still clearly there, like it's one of those things where you turn the screen off or look off axis and it's very obvious, but once you get into the flow of using the phone it's very easy to forget about. honestly, the most important difference here with the hinge is actually just that it folds completely flat now. so every z-flip up to this point has folded shut with just like a little small Gap that could get, you know, a little bit of dust, a little bit of sand, a little bit of dirt inside, which is not great when the inside screen is the most delicate part of the phone. so now all these folding phones across the board from everybody, they're all working towards this gapless close. it's still technically not fully dust resistant. I mean it has an ipx8 rating. again. the 8 means it can be splashed, but the X means no official dust resistance yet. but it's also an even more satisfying clap now. and yeah, it's also just it's slightly more firm. it's a nice sturdy hinge. every year, which is hard to appreciate until you go back to the earliest folding phones and see how loose those were. I still personally hardly ever use those like half folded features where you can like prop it up and use the camera like this or like watch videos or whatever. but look, a good hinge is a good hinge. but the biggest change to this phone is clearly the bigger screen on the outside. so let's talk about it. so the z-flip has gone from this tiny little 1.9 inch slot to a full squared 3.4 inch 720p cover screen called the flex window. this is huge. it's a massive Improvement. that's way more screen for checking the time or reading notifications, way more screen for framing up pictures with the primary cameras on the outside. it's a huge win for all that stuff and then also sends us this huge new screen. they've sort of organized this UI of up to 11 pages of apps that you can flip through, uh sort of encouraging you to use the outside screen more. you're using a phone without even opening it, so you can fully unlock and then just start swiping over to either quickly View and organize your notifications or move between all these full screen widgets. I have a calendar widget, of course, which is scrollable. you've got a scrollable weather widget. basically, these are all not even really widgets. they're more like mini apps that have been specifically Built For This outside screen to be fully functional and optimized. and then it, if you're feeling bold, you can also jump into the lab settings and start enabling other non-optimized apps to also work on the outside screen. so there's no question you can do way more with this outside screen than you ever could before. on the flip, the question that's up to you now really is just: will you actually use it? like? how will you use it? and it's a surprisingly hard question to answer- like when I first saw the phone get released. you know, at first you see that gets a bigger outside screen, but I honestly thought I wouldn't use it much like. I thought I would just continue to use the phone mostly open and I would enjoy the barrier between me and endless Doom scrolling and maybe I'd check the time or some notifications a little bit more on the outside, but I was wrong. basically, the thing that I found I do much more often, especially like early in the day, is notification management: just triaging going through at the beginning through a bunch of notifications and clearing through the ones I don't need reading the ones that I do need to see. that's way better than opening the phone and like accidentally starting to Doom scroll through Tick Tock or something. so in the lab settings there's basically only a few apps that you can actually officially enable on the outside screen. it's basically Maps, messaging apps and then Netflix and YouTube. for some reason for you psychos out there, I definitely tried to answer some texts with the full qwerty keyboard that shows up on the outside screen now and, yeah, it technically works, but it's like: all right, do we really want to be doing this? like my hands are too big to be typing on this small of a keyboard regularly. maybe a few quick responses to stuff here and there, maybe voice to text a little more often, but nothing too crazy. there's actually also even a whole app in the Samsung Galaxy store called good luck, with an extension called multi-star, and basically, if you have both of these, it lets you add a launcher to the outside screen with literally any app on your phone, and so you can go through and experiment and find all kinds of weird stuff. that kind of works here. like you can technically just scroll through Twitter through X if you want to, you can flip through your favorite Reddit app before it disappears, or you can move around Spotify playlists, and these are all kind of not bad. there are also plenty of apps that are an absolute nightmare, that look ridiculous in a square, so I wouldn't recommend that, but I still feel like the whole point of having a flipping phone Remains the Same, like I this barrier between open and and shut. like it's nice to have the outside functionality, but this action really signifies okay, now I'm about to get in and like actually do something on my phone. it just really becomes up to you where that line is of, like when do you open it versus when you do something on the outside, and I think that my theory is: it's just time, it's just how long does that action take? so if it's just checking your notifications or just reading the time or something quick like that, or pausing your music, that takes two seconds green light, like that could be on the outside screen, but watching a two-hour Netflix documentary or something that takes like writing an email. you don't want to do that on the outside screen. that's. that's a red light. and then there's a whole bunch of stuff kind of somewhere in the middle, like flipping through a new playlist in Spotify maybe, or checking your calendar, or just like little brief stuff that's up to you. so yeah, if I could give Samsung any feedback on this thing that they've made here, I mean I think they will continue to settle into this General shape. I think they're pretty locked in with it. but two things: one, the outside screen is 720p and if you look closely enough you can see some pixels, so maybe a little resolution bump would be nice. but I think more importantly actually is ltpo. this is a 60 hertz outside screen, so it's 60 hertz all the time. and I think if you had an ltpo screen, first of all it would match the 120 hertz Max refresh of the inside, which it's not the end of the world that they're different, but also that could save battery life, being able to go down to one Hertz when you're only just like play pausing music or reading a quick notification or something that could help with the relatively small batteries on these phones, oh and uh, maybe add decks. that would be kind of nice too. so, all right, at the end of the day, should you buy the z-flip 5.. honestly, the truth is that I think this is the best folding phone on the planet for the most people right now. it's a great high-end chip. the cameras are still solid. the battery life is at least decent. like the fingerprint reader is super fast. it hits a lot of fundamental stuff. it's not missing any massive features. you got wireless charging, ipx8 and they raise the base storage from 128 to a respectable 256 gigs for the thousand dollar starting price, which is about as good as it gets with foldables. and yeah, the colors aren't that interesting. but I do love a extremely easy to install dbrand skin on the back, since it's literally just a square of glass, so I'd drop the icon skin on there. easiest install of my life. but yeah, until they do make some big jump in the form factor or some change to this thing, as long as they're settling into this, this is the safest, easiest to recommend foldable on the planet, easy and it even has a five year window of security updates. like this feels like this feels like the iPhone of Android foldables. I made a video about the iPhone, of Android. I'll link that below if you want to check that out too. but either way, that's been it. thanks for watching. catch you in the next one, peace."}, {"title": "Tesla Solar Roof Review: Was it Worth It?",

1823.52, "duration": 3.0}], "text": "[Music]\nhi my name is Marquez Brownlee and I\nhave not paid for electricity\nin a year I have a bunch of electrical\nappliances computers game console TVs\nair conditioning and I drive an electric\ncar to and from work every single day\nand charge it home zero dollar bill so I\nknow I had a lot of questions about how\nthis stuff worked how much it cost how\nmuch it generated a whole bunch of that\nstuff before I got started and now I\nfinally have all the answers\nlet's get into it\nso I have had solar panels on my roof at\nhome for the past 12 months now and I\nwaited this long specifically because\nnow I've seen all four seasons and I've\nobserved a wide variety of performance\nand I've run all the numbers and I have\na lot of thoughts about them so I want\nto share them so first of all for those\nfamiliar there are a lot of options for\nsolar systems at home I like that\nthey're called solar systems too but\nthere are a lot of different companies\nwho make solar systems to power all the\nelectrical needs of a home including an\nelectric car so I know I wanted to do\nthis for a while since the whole point\nfor me was to be able to drive electric\nfor the foreseeable future and actually\nbe able to know that the energy is\ncoming from a sustainable Source the Sun\nbut first it's actually important to\nunderstand that a big part a big part of\nthis solar system is batteries as well\nso a normal house is connected to the\nelectrical grid and whenever something\nin the house whether it's a light bulb\nor a computer or an appliance calls for\nelectricity it pulls from the grid and\nand Spins up a meter on the side of the\nhouse that tallies how much you've\npulled then at the end of the month you\nget billed for how much electricity\nyou've used great now if you just add\nsolar panels to this house when the sun\nshines during the day on those tiles it\ncan use that electricity to directly\npower things in the house now of course\nif it's cloudy or if you have a bunch of\nstuff on all at once and the demand is\nmore than the power from the Sun is\nproviding then it'll pull the rest of\nwhat it needs from the grid and spin the\nmeter as well but most importantly as\nsoon as the sun goes down the\nelectricity generated goes to zero and\nit just so happens that most people come\nhome from work as the sun is going down\nand that's when they turn on all the\nlights and do the laundry and charge the\ncar Etc so you're still going to be\npulling from the grid for most stuff now\nthat's actually fine for most people\nbecause if the goal which a lot of\npeople's goal is is to have a zero\ndollar electricity bill then this can\nactually be accomplished because the\npower company will hopefully depending\non where you live but ideally be running\nsomething called net metering so what\nthis means is when the Sun Shines on the\nroof and excess electricity is being\ngenerated because nobody's home the\nhouse actually spins the electrical\nmeter backwards as it sends extra\nelectricity back to the grid then when\nthe Sun goes down and you get home and\nuse a bunch of electricity from the grid\nthe meter spins back forwards and so\nideally the total usage is zero net zero\nthat's how you end up with the zero\ndollar electricity bill which is super\ncool but what if you want to sort of\ngraduate to the next level of\nsustainability what if you want to be\ncompletely independent of the grid\ntotally Off the Grid\nwell that's when batteries come in so\nadd battery storage to this system and\nnow the loop is complete so when the sun\nshines during the day and you're not\nhome it fills up the batteries\neffectively storing Sunshine energy and\nthen when you get home and the sun goes\ndown you can keep using that extra solar\nenergy that you stored with all the\nelectrical needs that you have until the\nnext morning when the sun comes out\nagain and starts filling up those\nbatteries again so with a system like\nthis you can theoretically not just have\na zero dollar power bill but never\nactually pull from the Grid at all\nyou're completely self-sustainable you\nnever have to worry about a power outage\never again you won't even know if a\npower outage happens that is the Off the\nGrid dream theoretically anyway at the\nbeginning of this process that was my\ngoal so there's a lot of different\noptions for solar system setups with\ndifferent solar tile manufacturers and\ndifferent battery manufacturers and\ndifferent companies that will install\nall these things and there's a 1000\ndifferent combos that you could piece\ntogether with different companies with\ndifferent offers in your area to make\nsomething that works I kind of went with\nkind of a crazy but also a made sense\nsolution which is just one company for\neverything which would be Tesla so it is\na Tesla solar roof Tesla power walls for\nbatteries and then the Tesla app to\nmonitor and control everything and\nreally the main reason I went this route\nwas for Simplicity and integration this\nI paid a price premium for this this was\nnot the cheapest option you can spec a\nmuch cheaper combo of solar panels and\nbatteries and things like that\nbut just to have everything on the same\npage and have everything talking to each\nother seamlessly this made the most\nsense so then once I decided to go with\nTesla then the other choice you might\nhave heard about is either solar panels\nbolted to the roof or these actual solar\ntiles which are new roof tiles that are\nactually hundreds of tiny solar panels\nthemselves all interconnected to make a\nnormal looking roof that's actually a\ngiant solar panel and that is the one\nthat I went for and this is why I say\nthis is this was a crazy option because\nI I did not actually need a new roof\nmost people who go with the solar tiles\noption would either have an old roof\nthat needs replacing soon or they're\nlike about to build a new house and this\nwill be the new roof that they put on it\nI wasn't in either of those situations\nbut also this was the way to get by far\nthe largest total array with the most\ncoverage with as many pitches as my roof\nhas and also aesthetically it looks\nreally good too I gotta say there's carb\nappeal either way I make my decision I'm\ngoing with the solar roof I'm going\nTesla's full integrated setup\nfrom there\nnot gonna lie it is quite a process\nthere is a lot of uh of paperwork and\nHoops to jump through also with Tesla's\nthey've been kind of in and out of\nreliability like over the years they've\nbeen on and off with actually making\nthis product they've paused\ninstallations for a while it was briefly\ncanceled and then it came back and there\nwere supply chain issues I remember\nreading about all this and I was kind of\nworried uh but for whatever reason when\nI ordered which was in 2021 basically\neverything went perfectly smooth as well\nas it could have gone you get assigned a\na Tesla advisor just like for your\nproject for your solar project they walk\nyou through the whole process from the\npaperwork with the town from beginning\nto end so there was an ordering process\ninspection a measuring process quotes\nyou know filling out paperwork with the\ntown you actually when you're first\ntrying to get an estimate you actually\nsubmit your address and they go look on\nGoogle Images and look at your roof with\nsatellite imagery and give you an\ninitial quote then once you're locked in\nand you decide you want to go through\nwith it they'll actually come to your\nhome with professionals and actually\nmeasure it and then give you a precise\nreal quote and then start to order all\nthe materials you eventually get to the\npoint where you get an install date you\nstart scheduling things out and then\nthey come through with all the boxes of\nsolar panels and they took up my whole\ndriveway for a couple days there are\npeople who have actually walked through\nthis entire process in great detail I'll\ntry to link a good one below on YouTube\nbut at the end of the day\nfor me the process I started when I\nsigned the purchase agreement which was\nin November 2021 and finished with the\nactivation of the system in July 2022 so\neight months\nbut now that it's done uh we get to nerd\nout about the numbers sorry in advance\nto anyone who doesn't like numbers I\nfeel like that's really the only way to\nexplain how good it is and what's\nhappening with them so there's about to\nbe a lot of them let's get into it so\nfirst of all the specs right so this is\na\n29.313 kilowatt solar array size your\nboy's got a big roof and then there are\nthree power wall threes which totals 40\nand a half kilowatt hours and then this\nis the Tesla app where all of the\nlearnings and all the numbers happen\nwhen the system first got activated I\njust remember like seeing it light up in\nthe app for the first time the numbers\njump up and just kind of you just kind\nof get I could stare at the app for a\nwhile like I could really get lost in\nthe numbers maybe it's just because I'm\na numbers person but there's a lot going\non and that's it was exciting to see it\nall in real time and learn a lot of\nstuff so I think the app is really well\ndone and it lets you visualize how much\nenergy the solar array is currently\ncapturing how much energy the home is\nusing and the state of charge and power\noutput or input of the powerwall\nbatteries and then of course anything\nhappening with the electro grid so you\ncan see at this exact moment in time on\na sunny morning in July the panels are\nbringing in seven kilowatts of power\nfive of which are powering the house the\nlast two of which are going into the\npower walls which are 38 full and it's\nnot touching the Grid at all there's\nalready a lot of terms being thrown\naround here here's a good way of\nthinking about it kilowatts is a measure\nof power so one kilowatt is a thousand\nWatts a kilowatt hour though is a unit\nof energy collected so a Tesla Model S\nbattery for example is a 100 roughly 100\nkilowatt hours and so if that battery\nwere to Output a hundred kilowatts for\nan hour then it would be at zero so for\nmy setup the power wall three each one\nis about 13 and a half kilowatt hours\neach so that totals forty and a half\nkilowatt hours since I have three and\nthey support a maximum power output in\nor out of 15 and a half kilowatts and\nthen the solar system being 29.3\nkilowatts means that basically it seems\nlike the theoretical maximum of the\nelectricity that can be collected at any\none time is 29.3 kilowatts but as you're\nabout to see a little bit later that\nnumber may or may not be accurate either\nway just hanging out in the Tesla app\nfor a while which you do a lot for the\nfirst few weeks I learned a lot I\nlearned a lot about what takes a lot of\nenergy what takes a little bit of energy\nsome of it which did surprise me I also\nlearned that sort of the basic like\nexistence level for this house is like 4\n100 watts of power just because things\nare plugged in even if every light is\noff it just sort of sits around 400\nwatts but you know charging a phone or\nturning on a light or something like\nthat basically doesn't make a dent at\nall it doesn't show up in the app uh\nturning on a TV might only take about\n100 Watts uh or 0.1 kilowatts a computer\ncan pull three to 500 watts if it's\ntaking a lot of power but surprisingly\nthe big spikes come from the microwave\nand the toaster for sure but the two\nabsolute biggest draws of electricity in\nthis house by far and I think probably\nwith a lot of others are number two air\nconditioning\nand number one buy a country mile is\ncharging the electric car\nI think the best way to look at this is\nactually by Seasons so like I said this\nsystem got activated in July so in the\nmiddle of the summer so typical summer\nday in New Jersey is pretty awesome for\na solar customer the days are long we\nget a lot of sun it's great this is what\na summer day looks like in the app and\nthis is a pretty good day for solar so\nyou can see the sunrise is around 6 a.m\nthe peak is around noon and then this\ndrop off till sunset around 8 to 9 p.m\nit's a lot of sun and on this day it\ngenerated a ridiculous 260 kilowatt\nhours of electricity not all days are\ngoing to look like perfect curves like\nthis by the way in fact the previous day\nwas pretty cloudy so you can see it only\ngenerated 65 kilowatt hours the next\nprevious was better again but yeah a\ntypical summer day you know get around\n200 kilowatt hours from the Sun and then\nI think this view is the most helpful it\nlooks kind of wild at first but you can\nquickly tell how to read it it's\nbasically how much power the house is\ntaking and then where it's getting that\npower from so over overnight you can see\nthese spikes from the house are where\nI'm pulling from the grid this is\nactually just air conditioning overnight\nthen when the sun comes out and the day\nheats up and the air conditioner turns\non the lights and the appliances\neverything comes on it starts drawing\nmore power but it's totally covered by\nsolar as you can see here and it's also\nfilling up the power walls with extra\nsolar as this happens so later in the\nday when the Sun goes down that power\ndraw is also supplemented by the power\nwall batteries there were a lot of\nsummer days like this on the absolute\nbest day in this time I think I\ngenerated almost 300 kilowatt hours of\nelectricity but because of how much the\nhouse is using from the AC to charging\nthe car every single day\nfrequently I'd use 200 plus kilowatt\nhours of electricity during the day so\nmy net grid usage would typically in\nthese summer months be zero to slightly\nnegative maybe up to negative 50\nkilowatt hours on a good day meaning I\nwould generate and sell back to the grid\n50 kilowatt hours more than I used solid\nso after summer there is the fall which\nyou know the days are starting to get a\nlittle bit shorter but also notably the\ntemperatures drop off quite a bit so\ngetting less a little bit less Sun but\nalso using a lot less air conditioning\nso here is a normal fall day in the\nmiddle of October production day by day\nis dropping down now here into the low\nhundreds uh this is a day that I got\njust over 120 kilowatt hours of solar\npretty Cloud free day again as you can\ntell by the graph and again if you look\nat the home usage there's even smaller\nspikes and a smaller curve of air\nconditioning during the day so The\nhouse's needs are actually completely\ncovered by solar and then once the sun\ngoes down and the power wall takes over\nit actually did not touch the Grid at\nall which is pretty sick and this was\nactually very common throughout the fall\nturns out the fall and the spring are\nthe times where I generated the most\nexcess electricity with basically\neveryday ending with net negative and\nthen\nthere is winter and it turns out uh\nwinter can be a well in the Northeast\nareas especially brutal on these setups\nfor a couple of reasons like first of\nall as far as solar these are the days\nwhen we're getting the days are the\nshortest like the sun sets at like 4 P.M\nwhich is insane but that's real but it\nalso turns out that most of the days are\ncloudy I didn't really realize this like\ntruly until I started looking through\nall the graphs but it's like one out of\nevery 10 days is actually sunny and I\nyou know I know it's cold and everything\nbut I didn't realize how many days in\nthe winter are just cloud cover all day\nso then also my homes uh I'm pointing\nlike you can see it my home's air\nconditioning is electric but my heating\nis natural gas so my natural gas bill is\njust going up and there's nothing my\nsolar can do about it but on top of all\nthat you got to think about the car and\nelectric cars are far less efficient in\nthe winter when it's cold than any other\ntime of the year battery trees have a\ncertain temperature they like to be at\nthey like to operate at that temperature\nso they spend more extra energy getting\nup to and staying at that temperature so\na normal drive for me might take say 15\npercent of the battery on a commute\nduring the summer that same Drive during\nthe winter will take 20 25 30 of the\nbattery driving the exact same way just\nbecause it's so cold so that is a lot\nmore electrical energy so here's what\nsome typical days in the winter would\nlook like literally only generating 20\nto 70 kilowatt hours of electricity in a\nwhole day like cloudy days would\nliterally only be a handful and then for\nhome use so I actually went through this\nphase of like maybe I should charge my\ncar less often to be off the grid more I\nwas kind of playing around with that so\nI would charge like every two to three\ndays but it honestly doesn't really\nmatter you can sort of see which days I\nactually plug the car in and to be fair\nthe power wall handled it but it did\nempty it out so the next day I'm pulling\nfrom the grid until the sun comes up so\nit was basically like a lot of days\naround zero and then every time I had to\nplug in the car to fill back up there\nwould be a huge dent just a huge\npositive net you stay on the calendar so\nI actually had positive net grid usage\nmonths for all of November December and\nJanuary so I was pulling from the grid\nmore than I produced solar all of those\nmonths but then sure enough when we get\nto Spring things flip super fast it\nturns out if you were to guess which\nmonth I would generate the most solar or\nthe most excess solar what would you\nthink you'd probably guess like sometime\nin the peak of the Summer with the\nlongest day June July\nuh for me it was May\nin May I used 6 500 kilowatt hours of\nelectricity but I generated nearly 8 500\nkilowatt hours of electricity and I\ndidn't even realize this is another\nthing you don't really know for real\nuntil you look at the data and I'm\nlooking at the graphs and may had\nbasically every single day sunny during\nthat month I think I had one cloudy day\nin May but June and July we do get a lot\nmore thunderstorms out here in the\nNortheast and that actually does take a\nreal hit on total solar that's that's\ncloud cover so they didn't generate\nquite as much solar as May we're just\nlearning weather patterns out here\nthrough graphs of solar generation uh\nthis is also around the same month that\nI got the eight sleep so the eight sleep\nis a pod cover that fits on a mattress\nlike a fitted sheet but it's temperature\ncontrolled so it can heat and cool each\nside of the bed independently they\nreached out around May to be a sponsor\nand I said yes so that's when I\ninstalled it I wouldn't say it it\nreplaced the need for aircon positioning\nit didn't but it did actually\nlegitimately decrease the total air\nconditioning you need when the bed is\ncooled off and the house doesn't have to\nbe as cool so when it literally cools\nthe bed before you get in stays cool the\nwhole night for optimal sleep and then\nwarms you up in the morning on autopilot\nevery single day which is sweet so now\nthat I know that air conditioning is the\nnumber two draw of electricity in my\nentire house and if you don't drive an\nelectric car it's probably your number\none draw then it's good to know that you\ncan you can do something like this and\nobviously it'll take a lot less\nelectricity from the wall than air\nconditioning would also if you're\ncurious I talked about this on dope Tech\nbut it's turned out to be pretty awesome\nobviously sleuth is super important and\ntemperature is like top of the list for\nSleep Quality falling asleep faster\nwaking up less so investing in your\nsleep makes a ton of sense on top of\nmaybe cutting into your AC use so if you\nwant to get a pod cover for yourself you\ncan actually use code MKBHD on their\nsite and get 200 off so I'll leave a\nlink in the description and next thing\ninto eight sleep before sponsoring the\nvideo so it's time for the the big\nsummary I've had this solar setup for a\nfull year now all four seasons it's time\nto run the numbers see if it was really\nworth it and see if it's actually good\nso let's start with the money question\nhere the this like I said was nowhere\nnear the cheapest possible option of\ncourse going with solar panels and\nbatteries a lot of different possible\nsetups so my setup with the solar tiles\nall the materials all of the labor\ninstallation everything and the three\nbatteries everything together was one\nhundred and twenty thousand nine hundred\nforty eight dollars and four cents but\nalso as you can see there's a federal\ntax credit down here of nearly thirty\nthousand dollars bringing the total cost\nto me down to right around ninety three\nthousand dollars so the tax credit does\nfluctuate quite a bit uh it's actually\ngone up like a lot since I ordered like\na year and a half ago whatever it was uh\nit's up to 30 now in New Jersey so it's\ncalled the uh New Jersey solar\ninvestment tax credit if I ordered today\nit would have been 8 thousand dollars\nmore off\nbut you know it's fine it's fine\neverything's fine I'm not mad it's fine\nbut the main question you typically see\nwith an investment like this is what is\nthe payoff period how long does it take\nbefore that investment pays for itself\nin saved electricity so that's a good\nquestion and I had to do quite a bit of\nmath here because every bill is\ndifferent every week every month of\nelectricity costs different amounts\nactually my provider literally has\ndifferent electricity rates every single\nhour and there are different averages\nper day per week per season but if I do\na sort of a sweeping average for each\nmonth and how much electricity I've been\nusing the 54 megawatt hours of\nelectricity that I've used in the past\nyear would have cost about nine thousand\nsix hundred sixty dollars so again\nthat's a lot but obviously air\nconditioning takes up a lot and a lot of\nthat is driving an electric car every\nsingle day so of course my gas bill has\nbeen zero dollars this whole time but\nyou know that's where it comes from so\nif if you divide that out by the total\ncost that I paid it comes out to just\nunder 10 years 9.6 years so if you if\nyou Google like what's a good payback\nperiod for a solar setup the answer that\nthe AI pops up with is like six to ten\nyears which you know if I think about it\nit makes sense obviously and that's\ngreat because if the panels are\nwarranted for 25 years and you pay them\noff in 10 years then they're just paying\nyou extra for the next 15 years however\nlong you're in that house which is great\nso mine being on the longer end of that\nam I mad at that not really I think\nthat's fine\num I also do know that there are a\ncouple of things that could that I could\nthat could have been different to make\nthat payback period shorter actually the\nnumber one suggestion typically would be\nlike okay if you want to make the\npayback period shorter get a less\nexpensive setup and that would make\nsense but also you have to keep in mind\nthe coverage really matters here so I\ncould have gone with a much less\nexpensive actually a solar panel array\nfrom Tesla on the same exact roof and\nbecause of all the pitches on the roof\nthey estimated they could have put\npanels down on certain parts and it\nwould have totaled a smaller 19 kilowatt\narray instead of the 29 kilowatts of the\nsolar tiles I know that because that's\nactually what I first signed up for an\nestimate for as I was like juggling the\nidea in my head would that have had a\nshorter payback period or would that\nhave been offset by much less\nelectricity being produced and taking\nlonger to pay for itself I don't know\nbut the other part of that equation that\nI'm thinking about now is just like I\nshould just use more electricity\nso that it pays for itself faster I want\nto get my values worth I am constantly\nin net negative so I can afford to use\nway more electricity and so I thought\nmaybe about switching\num you know various appliances that\naren't electric yet maybe even switching\nheating to electrical so that may be in\nmy future but now for all the\nmiscellaneous weird quirks of having\nthis brand new piece of tech on top of\nmy house because believe me there are\nquite a few so first of all on the uh\nthe zero dollar electricity bill\nfor the whole year that is real which is\npretty awesome but it's also interesting\nthat I was able to achieve the zero\ndollar bill monthly but I also used\npositive net grid energy for those three\nmonths during the winter so you might be\nwondering wait a second how does that\nwork and the answer is net metering\ncredits it turns out they roll over\nmonth to month but then they get reset\nonce per year so meaning when it was\nfirst activated and in the First full\nmonth of August I produced more than I\nused I ended the month with a credit of\nthe difference which was negative 255\nkilowatt hours and it says that on the\nbill so that means the next month even\nif I used 255 kilowatt hours more than I\nproduce with solar I would still have a\nzero dollar bill because I have that\ncredit to play with but month after\nmonth after month during the summer and\nthen the fall I was building up more and\nmore negative credits so that by the\ntime we got to Winter those three months\nin a row I was eating into the credit\nbut I didn't eat all of it so I didn't\nget all the way back to zero so the bill\nwas still zero dollars every month so\nthen another fun thing uh power outages\nI have had a few power outages uh since\ngetting the solar system installed most\nof them just because of thunderstorms\nand the grid going down for a bit I\ndidn't even notice which was pretty sick\nI did not notice the lights didn't even\nflicker I didn't actually know until I\ngot a notification on my phone from the\nTesla app saying hey just so you know\nyou're disconnected from the grid right\nnow but you're running off of solar and\nor batteries right now so everything is\ngood and you've got you know x amount of\nhours of backup left and it should get\nyou till the next morning when the sun\ncomes up again and there's even a storm\nwatch feature that will preemptively\nmake sure the power walls are full if it\nknows the big storm is coming and\nhonestly there is a pretty sweet Peace\nof Mind knowing for a fact that if I\ndon't charge the car the power walls\nhave more than enough to just use the\nhouse like normal until the next morning\nair conditioning appliances literally\nwhatever and it'll be fine and when the\nsum comes out again it'll start powering\neverything I could be completely off the\ngrid for days or weeks at a time if I\nfind somewhere else to charge the car\nnow another fun fact in the winter in\nthe Northeast you probably already know\nwe get snow and apparently the surface\nof the solar tiles the solar roof uh\nstays just above freezing just a little\nbit warmer than a roof would which has\nsome interesting side effects most\nnotably when it snows a little bit uh\nthe snow simply hits the roof and melts\nso it never actually accumulates on the\nroof and then the solar can continue to\nwork I mean if it's cloudy you get a\nlittle bit of solar but it keeps working\nand then you're the only house that\ndoesn't have a white roof because\nthere's no no snow on it but when it\nsnows heavy like like a lot which it\ndoes a few times what happens is it\nsnows a ton and it actually does\naccumulate and then when it accumulates\nthe outside layer kind of insulates the\nbottom and so the Bottom now has room to\nget warm again and so it warms up and\ncreates a thin layer of water and then\nthe whole thing just slides off of the\nroof like a sheet of ice like the whole\naccumulated layer slides off on the\nwater so I didn't actually get videos of\nthis happening with my own roof but\nthere are some YouTube videos of this\nhappening on YouTube it's kind of crazy\nliterally the whole roof section slides\noff in sheets and it actually lands in\npiles around the house sometimes\nblocking a door or a driveway it's not a\nsmall deal it was a little bit\nfrightening the first time it happened\nbecause I didn't realize what that loud\nbooming noise was I was like is there is\nthere thunder in the in a snowstorm\nthat's kind of weird but then I like see\nit in the window like sliding off of the\nroof which is crazy then it piles up\naround the door and then then it I gotta\nshovel it but then last but not least\nthe fun fact uh I lied to you all uh the\nthe zero that sounds silly the zero\ndollar power bill\nis actually kind of a lie because my\npower company ruined it every month for\nthe past 12 months my electricity bill\nhas been\n5.75\nthat's just because I have zeroed out\nall the charges thanks to that metering\nbut they charge 575 every month\nbasically just to have an account\nso\nthanks guys so let's just to wrap\neverything up here my one year\nconclusion uh this is an awesome piece\nof bleeding edge Tech you can tell it's\nbleeding edge because it's still rapidly\nevolving over time and it's still very\nexpensive so for early adopters like me\nwho are willing to take the plunge\nwilling to take that risk a little bit\nit can be really awesome it kind of\nreminds me of electric cars there are a\nlot more affordable solar setups out\nthere that are making a meaningful\ndifference for a lot of people in a lot\nof different situations all over the\nworld there's also much more massive\nhuge solar setups as well but I think we\ncan kind of all get behind a technology\nmaking more sustainable energy more\nuseful more efficient and More Beautiful\nover time I definitely learned a lot\nwith this process mostly in like how\nmuch electricity certain things\nspecifically use but also how much\nelectricity a roof with solar panels on\nit can collect in different times of\nyear different seasons and different\nsituations but I don't think honestly I\ndon't think I would change a thing I\ndon't think I would change anything in\nwhat I did\nI've been probably waiting like six\nmonths to get a

vehicles in a year or two by\n2025 would all support bi-directional\ncharging which would be amazing I don't\nknow that that's actually going to\nhappen but having the cars be able to\nnot just charge other cars but even\npotentially serve as your House's backup\nbattery would be pretty incredible these\ncar batteries as we're learning are\nalready way bigger and can support way\nmore power output than any power wall\nany home battery one model S battery is\nequivalent to like seven or eight power\nwalls so who knows if Tesla actually\ndoes or not but as of today with the\nright box on the wall with the right\ninverter the F-150 Lightning which has\nan even bigger battery can actually be\nyour House's backup battery so I think\nthe number of EVS that support this\nfeature should only be slowly going up\nbut I think ideally there's a world in\nthe future where instead of needing like\na huge no the current thing needing a\nbig solar setup and all these fancy\nbatteries all you really need is a small\nsolar OA an inverter and your car\nbattery and you have of the ability to\nbe completely functional during any\nextended power outage or any emergency\nbecause we live in a world where there's\nanother news story every week about the\nelectrical grid being taxed and how\nthese heat waves are running people's\ngrids and air conditioners into the\nground and too much of it is

name is Marquez Brownlee and I have not paid for electricity in a year. I have a bunch of electrical appliances- computers, game console TVs, air conditioning- and I drive an electric car to and from work every single day and charge it home zero dollar bill. so I know I had a lot of questions about how this stuff worked, how much it cost, how much it generated a whole bunch of that stuff before I got started, and now I finally have all the answers. let's get into it. so I have had solar panels on my roof at home for the past 12 months now, and I waited this long specifically because now I've seen all four seasons and I've observed a wide variety of performance and I've run all the numbers and I have a lot of thoughts about them. so I want to share them. so, first of all, for those familiar, there are a lot of options for solar systems at home. I like that they're called solar systems too, but there are a lot of different companies who make solar systems to power all the electrical needs of a home, including an electric car. so I know I wanted to do this for a while, since the whole point for me was to be able to drive electric for the foreseeable future and actually be able to know that the energy is coming from a sustainable Source- the Sun. but first it's actually important to understand that a big part- a big part- of this solar system is batteries as well. so a normal house is connected to the electrical grid and whenever something in the house- whether it's a light bulb or a computer or an appliance- calls for electricity, it pulls from the grid and and Spins up a meter on the side of the house that tallies how much you've pulled. then at the end of the month you get billed for how much electricity you've used. great, now, if you just add solar panels to this house, when the sun shines during the day on those tiles, it can use that electricity to directly power things in the house. now, of course, if it's cloudy or if you have a bunch of stuff on all at once and the demand is more than the power from the Sun is providing, then it'll pull the rest of what it needs from the grid and spin the meter as well. but most importantly, as soon as the sun goes down, the electricity generated goes to zero, and it just so happens that most people come home from work as the sun is going down, and that's when they turn on all the lights and do the laundry and charge the car, Etc. so you're still going to be pulling from the grid for most stuff. now that's actually fine for most people, because if the goal- which a lot of people's goal is- is to have a zero dollar electricity bill, then this can actually be accomplished because the power company will hopefully- depending on where you live, but ideally- be running something called net metering. so what this means is, when the Sun Shines on the roof and excess electricity is being generated because nobody's home, the house actually spins the electrical meter backwards as it sends extra electricity back to the grid. then, when the Sun goes down and you get home and use a bunch of electricity from the grid, the meter spins back forwards and so, ideally, the total usage is zero, net zero. that's how you end up with the zero dollar electricity bill, which is super cool. but what if you want to sort of graduate to the next level of sustainability? what if you want to be completely independent of the grid, totally Off the Grid? well, that's when batteries come in. so add battery storage to this system and now the loop is complete. so when the sun shines during the day and you're not home, it fills up the batteries, effectively storing Sunshine energy, and then when you get home and the sun goes down, you can keep using that extra solar energy that you stored, with all the electrical needs that you have, until the next morning when the sun comes out again and starts filling up those batteries again. so with a system like this, you can theoretically not just have a zero dollar power bill but never actually pull from the Grid at all. you're completely self-sustainable. you never have to worry about a power outage- ever again. you won't even know if a power outage happens. that is the Off the Grid dream, theoretically anyway. at the beginning of this process that was my goal. so there's a lot of different options for solar system setups, with different solar tile manufacturers and different battery manufacturers and different companies that will install all these things, and there's a 1000 different combos that you could piece together with different companies with different offers in your area to make something that works. I kind of went with kind of a crazy but also a made sense solution which is just one company for everything, which would be Tesla. so it is a Tesla solar roof, Tesla power walls for batteries, and then the Tesla app to monitor and control everything. and really, the main reason I went this route was for Simplicity and integration. this I paid a price premium for this. this was not the cheapest option. you can spec a much cheaper combo of solar panels and batteries and things like that, but just to have everything on the same page and have everything talking to each other seamlessly, this made the most sense. so then, once I decided to go with Tesla, then the other choice you might have heard about is either solar panels bolted to the roof or these actual solar tiles, which are new roof tiles that are actually hundreds of tiny solar panels themselves all interconnected to make a normal looking roof that's actually a giant solar panel, and that is the one that I went for, and this is why I say this is. this was a crazy option, because I I did not actually need a new roof. most people who go with the solar tiles option would either have an old roof that needs replacing soon, or they're, like about to build a new house and this will be the new roof that they put on it. I wasn't in either of those situations, but also this was the way to get by far the largest total array, with the most coverage, with as many pitches as my roof has, and also aesthetically it looks really good too. I gotta say there's carb appeal. either way I make my decision: I'm going with the solar roof, I'm going Tesla's full integrated setup from there. not gonna lie, it is quite a process. there is a lot of uh, of paperwork and Hoops to jump through. also, with Tesla's, they've been kind of in and out of reliability, like over the years. they've been on and off with actually making this product. they've paused installations for a while. it was briefly canceled and then it came back and there were supply chain issues. I remember reading about all this and I was kind of worried, uh, but for whatever reason, when I ordered- which was in 2021, basically everything went perfectly smooth, as well as it could have gone. you get assigned a, a Tesla advisor, just like for your project, for your solar project. they walk you through the whole process, from the paperwork with the town, from beginning to end. so there was an ordering process, inspection, a measuring process, quotes, you know, filling out paperwork with the town. you actually, when you're first trying to get an estimate, you actually submit your address and they go. look on Google Images and look at your roof with satellite imagery and give you an initial quote. then, once you're locked in and you decide you want to go through with it, they'll actually come to your home with professionals and actually measure it and then give you a precise, real quote and then start to order all the materials. you eventually get to the point where you get an install date. you start scheduling things out and then they come through with all the boxes of solar panels and they took up my whole driveway for a couple days. there are people who have actually walked through this entire process in great detail. I'll try to link a good one below on YouTube. but at the end of the day, for me, the process I started when I signed the purchase agreement, which was in November 2021, and finished with the activation of the system in July 2022- so eight months. but now that it's done, uh, we get to nerd out about the numbers. sorry in advance to anyone who doesn't like numbers. I feel like that's really the only way to explain how good it is and what's happening with them. so there's about to be a lot of them. let's get into it. so, first of all, the specs: right. so this is a 29.313 kilowatt solar array size. your boy's got a big roof. and then there are three power wall threes, which totals 40 and a half kilowatt hours. and then this is the Tesla app, where all of the learnings and all the numbers happen. when the system first got activated, I just remember like seeing it light up in the app for the first time. the numbers jump up and just kind of you just kind of get. I could stare at the app for a while like I could really get lost in the numbers. maybe it's just because I'm a numbers person, but there's a lot going on and that's. it was exciting to see it all in real time and learn a lot of stuff. so I think the app is really well done and it lets you visualize how much energy the solar array is currently capturing, how much energy the home is using, and the state of charge and power output or input of the powerwall batteries, and then, of course, anything happening with the electro grid. so you can see, at this exact moment in time, on a sunny morning in July, the panels are bringing in seven kilowatts of power, five of which are powering the house, the last two of which are going into the power walls, which are 38 full, and it's not touching the Grid at all. there's already a lot of terms being thrown around here. here's a good way of thinking about it. kilowatts is a measure of power, so one kilowatt is a thousand Watts. a kilowatt hour, though, is a unit of energy collected, so a Tesla Model S battery, for example, is a 100- roughly 100- kilowatt hours, and so if that battery were to Output a hundred kilowatts for an hour, then it would be at zero. so for my setup, the power wall three- each one is about 13 and a half kilowatt hours each, so that totals forty and a half kilowatt hours, since I have three, and they support a maximum power output in or out of 15 and a half kilowatts. and then the solar system being 29.3 kilowatts means that, basically, it seems like the theoretical maximum of the electricity that can be collected at any one time is 29.3 kilowatts, but, as you're about to see a little bit later, that number may or may not be accurate. either way, just hanging out in the Tesla app for a while, which you do a lot for the first few weeks, I learned a lot. I learned a lot about what takes a lot of energy, what takes a little bit of energy, some of it, which did surprise me, I also learned that sort of the basic like existence level for this house is like 4, 100 watts of power just because things are plugged in. even if every light is off, it just sort of sits around 400 watts. but you know, charging a phone or turning on a light or something like that basically doesn't make a dent at all. it doesn't show up in the app. uh. turning on a TV might only take about 100 Watts. uh or 0.1 kilowatts. a computer can pull three to 500 watts if it's taking a lot of power. but surprisingly the big spikes come from the microwave and the toaster. for sure. but the two absolute biggest draws of electricity in this house by far- and I think probably with a lot of others- are number two, air conditioning, and number one- buy a country mile- is charging the electric car. I think the best way to look at this is actually by Seasons. so, like I said, this system got activated in July, so in the middle of the summer. so typical summer day in New Jersey is pretty awesome for a solar customer. the days are long, we get a lot of sun, it's great. this is what a summer day looks like in the app, and this is a pretty good day for solar. so you can see the sunrise is around 6 am, the peak is around noon and then this drop off till sunset, around 8 to 9 pm. it's a lot of sun and on this day it generated a ridiculous 260 kilowatt hours of electricity. not all days are going to look like perfect curves like this, by the way. in fact, the previous day was pretty cloudy, so you can see it only generated 65 kilowatt hours. the next, previous was better again. but yeah, a typical summer day, you know, get around 200 kilowatt hours from the Sun, and then I think this view is the most helpful. it looks kind of wild at first, but you can quickly tell how to read it. it's basically how much power the house is taking and then where it's getting that power from. so over overnight you can see these spikes from the house are where I'm pulling from the grid. this is actually just air conditioning overnight. then when the sun comes out and the day heats up and the air conditioner turns on the lights and the appliances, everything comes on. it starts drawing more power, but it's totally covered by solar, as you can see here, and it's also filling up the power walls with extra solar as this happens. so later in the day, when the Sun goes down, that power draw is also supplemented by the power wall batteries. there were a lot of summer days like this. on the absolute best day in this time, I think, I generated almost 300 kilowatt hours of electricity. but because of how much the house is using- from the AC to charging the car- every single day frequently I'd use 200 plus kilowatt hours of electricity during the day. so my net grid usage would typically in these summer months be zero to slightly negative, maybe up to negative 50 kilowatt hours on a good day, meaning I would generate and sell back to the grid 50 kilowatt hours more than I used solid. so after summer there is the fall, which you know. the days are starting to get a little bit shorter but also, notably, the temperatures drop off quite a bit, so getting less, a little bit less Sun, but also using a lot less air conditioning. so here is a normal fall day in the middle of October. production day by day is dropping down now here into the low hundreds. uh, this is a day that I got just over 120 kilowatt hours of solar, pretty Cloud free day, again, as you can tell by the graph. and again, if you look at the home usage, there's even smaller spikes and a smaller curve of air conditioning during the day, so The house's needs are actually completely covered by solar. and then, once the sun goes down and the power wall takes over, it actually did not touch the Grid at all, which is pretty sick, and this was actually very common throughout the fall turns out the fall and the spring are the times where I generated the most excess electricity, with basically everyday ending with net negative. and then there is winter and it turns out, uh, winter can be a well in the Northeast areas, especially brutal on these setups, for a couple of reasons, like, first of all, as far as solar, these are the days when we're getting. the days are the shortest, like the sun sets at like 4 PM, which is insane, but that's real. but it also turns out that most of the days are cloudy. I didn't really realize this, like truly, until I started looking through all the graphs, but it's like one out of every 10 days is actually sunny, and I, you know, I know it's cold and everything, but I didn't realize how many days in the winter are just cloud cover all day. so then also my homes. uh, I'm pointing, like you can see it, my home's air conditioning is electric but my heating is natural gas, so my natural gas bill is just going up and there's nothing my solar can do about it. but on top of all that, you got to think about the car, and electric cars are far less efficient in the winter, when it's cold, than any other time of the year. battery trees have a certain temperature they like to be at, they like to operate at that temperature, so they spend more extra energy getting up to and staying at that temperature. so a normal drive for me might take, say, 15 percent of the battery on a commute during the summer. that same Drive during the winter will take 20, 25, 30 of the battery driving the exact same way, just because it's so cold. so that is a lot more electrical energy. so here's what some typical days in the winter would look like: literally only generating 20 to 70 kilowatt hours of electricity in a whole day. like cloudy days would literally only be a handful. and then for home use. so I actually went through this phase of like. maybe I should charge my car less often to be off the grid more. I was kind of playing around with that so I would charge like every two to three days, but it honestly doesn't really matter. you can sort of see which days I actually plug the car in and, to be fair, the power wall handled it but it did empty it out. so the next day I'm pulling from the grid until the sun comes up. so it was basically like a lot of days around zero and then every time I had to plug in the car to fill back up there would be a huge dent, just a huge positive net. you stay on the calendar. so I actually had positive net grid usage months for all of November, December and January. so I was pulling from the grid more than I produced solar all of those months. but then, sure enough, when we get to Spring things flip super fast. it turns out if you were to guess which month I would generate the most solar or the most excess solar, what would you think? you'd probably guess, like sometime in the peak of the Summer with the longest day- June, July. uh, for me it was May. in May I used 6 500 kilowatt hours of electricity, but I generated nearly 8 500 kilowatt hours of electricity and I didn't even realize. this is another thing you don't really know for real until you look at the data and I'm looking at the graphs. and may had basically every single day sunny during that month. I think I had one cloudy day in May, but June and July we do get a lot more thunderstorms out here in the Northeast and that actually does take a real hit on total solar that's, that's cloud cover, so they didn't generate quite as much solar as May. we're just learning weather patterns out here through graphs of solar generation. uh, this is also around the same month that I got the eight sleep. so the eight sleep is a pod cover that fits on a mattress like a fitted sheet, but it's temperature controlled so it can heat and cool each side of the bed independently. they reached out around May to be a sponsor and I said yes. so that's when I installed it. I wouldn't say it it replaced the need for aircon positioning. it didn't, but it did actually legitimately decrease the total air conditioning you need when the bed is cooled off and the house doesn't have to be as cool. so when it literally cools the bed before you get in stays cool the whole night for optimal sleep and then warms you up in the morning on autopilot every single day, which is sweet. so now that I know that air conditioning is the number two draw of electricity in my entire house- and if you don't drive an electric car it's probably your number one draw- then it's good to know that you can. you can do something like this and obviously it'll take a lot less electricity from the wall than air conditioning would. also, if you're curious, I talked about this on dope Tech, but it's turned out to be pretty awesome. obviously, sleuth is super important and temperature is like top of the list for Sleep Quality- falling asleep faster, waking up less. so investing in your sleep makes a ton of sense on top of maybe cutting into your AC use. so if you want to get a pod cover for yourself, you can actually use code MKBHD on their site and get 200 off. so I'll leave a link in the description and next thing, into eight sleep before sponsoring the video. so it's time for the the big summary. I've had this solar setup for a full year now, all four seasons. it's time to run the numbers, see if it was really worth it and see if it's actually good. so let's start with the money question here. the this, like I said, was nowhere near the cheapest possible option, of course, going with solar panels and batteries, a lot of different possible setups. so my setup with the solar tiles, all the materials, all of the labor installation, everything and the three batteries, everything together was one hundred and twenty thousand nine hundred forty eight dollars and four cents. but also, as you can see, there's a federal tax credit down here of nearly thirty thousand dollars, bringing the total cost to me down to right around ninety three thousand dollars. so the tax credit does fluctuate quite a bit. uh, it's actually gone up like a lot since I ordered, like a year and a half ago, whatever it was. uh, it's up to 30 now in New Jersey. so it's called the- uh, New Jersey solar investment tax credit. if I ordered today it would have been 8 thousand dollars more off. but you know, it's fine, it's fine, everything's fine, I'm not mad, it's fine. but the main question you typically see with an investment like this is: what is the payoff period? how long does it take before that investment pays for itself in saved electricity? so that's a good question and I had to do quite a bit of math here because every bill is different every week, every month of electricity costs different amounts. actually, my provider literally has different electricity rates every single hour and there are different averages per day, per week, per season. but if I do a sort of a sweeping average for each month and how much electricity I've been using, the 54 megawatt hours of electricity that I've used in the past year would have cost about nine thousand six hundred sixty dollars. so again, that's a lot. but obviously air conditioning takes up a lot and a lot of that is driving an electric car every single day. so of course my gas bill has been zero dollars this whole time. but you know that's where it comes from. so if, if you divide that out by the total cost that I paid, it comes out to just under 10 years, 9.6 years. so if you, if you Google like what's a good payback period for a solar setup, the answer that the AI pops up with is like six to ten years, which you know. if I think about it, it makes sense, obviously, and that's great, because if the panels are warranted for 25 years and you pay them off in 10 years, then they're just paying you extra for the next 15 years, however long you're in that house, which is great. so mine being on the longer end of that, am I mad at that? not really. I think that's fine. um, I also do know that there are a couple of things that could that I could that could have been different. to make that payback period shorter, actually, the number one suggestion typically would be like: okay, if you want to make the payback period shorter, get a less expensive setup, and that would make sense. but also you have to keep in mind the coverage really matters here. so I could have gone with a much less expensive actually a solar panel array from Tesla on the same exact roof and because of all the pitches on the roof, they estimated they could have put panels down on certain parts and it would have totaled a smaller, 19 kilowatt array instead of the 29 kilowatts of the solar tiles. I know that because that's actually what I first signed up for an estimate for, as I was like juggling the idea in my head: would that have had a shorter payback period or would that have been offset by much less electricity being produced and taking longer to pay for itself? I don't know, but the other part of that equation that I'm thinking about now is just like I should just use more electricity so that it pays for itself faster. I want to get my values worth. I am constantly in net negative, so I can afford to use way more electricity, and so I thought maybe about switching- um, you know- various appliances that aren't electric yet maybe even switching heating to electrical. so that may be in my future. but now for all the miscellaneous, weird quirks of having this brand new piece of tech on top of my house, because, believe me, there are quite a few. so first of all, on the uh, the zero dollar electricity bill for the whole year. that is real, which is pretty awesome. but it's also interesting that I was able to achieve the zero dollar bill monthly, but I also used positive net grid energy for those three months during the winter. so you might be wondering- wait a second, how does that work? and the answer is net metering credits. it turns out they roll over month to month, but then they get reset once per year. so meaning when it was first activated and in the First full month of August I produced more than I used, I ended the month with a credit of the difference, which was negative 255 kilowatt hours, and it says that on the bill. so that means the next month. even if I used 255 kilowatt hours more than I produce with solar, I would still have a zero dollar bill because I have that credit to play with. but month after month after month, during the summer and then the fall, I was building up more and more negative credits so that by the time we got to Winter, those three months in a row, I was eating into the credit, but I didn't eat all of it, so I didn't get all the way back to zero, so the bill was still zero dollars every month. so then, another fun thing: uh, power outages. I have had a few power outages, uh, since getting the solar system installed, most of them just because of thunderstorms and the grid going down. for a bit I didn't even notice, which was pretty sick. I did not notice. the lights didn't even flicker. I didn't actually know until I got a notification on my phone from the Tesla app saying: hey, just so you know, you're disconnected from the grid right now, but you're running off of solar and or batteries right now. so everything is good and you've got you know x amount of hours of backup left and it should get you till the next morning when the sun comes up again. and there's even a storm watch feature that will preemptively make sure the power walls are full if it knows the big storm is coming. and honestly, there is a pretty sweet Peace of Mind knowing for a fact that if I don't charge the car, the power walls have more than enough to just use the house like normal until the next morning- air conditioning, appliances, literally whatever- and it'll be fine. and when the sum comes out again it'll start powering everything. I could be completely off the grid for days or weeks at a time if I find somewhere else to charge the car. now, another fun fact: in the winter in the Northeast, you probably already know, we get snow and apparently the surface of the solar tiles, the solar roof, uh, stays just above freezing, just a little bit warmer than a roof would, which has some interesting side effects, most notably when it snows a little bit. uh, the snow simply hits the roof and melts, so it never actually accumulates on the roof, and then the solar can continue to work. I mean, if it's cloudy, you get a little bit of solar, but it keeps working, and then you're the only house that doesn't have a white roof because there's no, no snow on it. but when it snows heavy, like like a lot, which it does a few times- what happens is it snows a ton and it actually does accumulate. and then when it accumulates, the outside layer kind of insulates the bottom and so the Bottom now has room to get warm again and so it warms up and creates a thin layer of water and then the whole thing just slides off of the roof like a sheet of ice, like the whole accumulated layer slides off on the water. so I didn't actually get videos of this happening with my own roof, but there are some YouTube videos of this happening on YouTube. it's kind of crazy. literally the whole roof section slides off in sheets and it actually lands in piles around the house, sometimes blocking a door or a driveway. it's not a small deal. it was a little bit frightening the first time it happened because I didn't realize what that loud booming noise was. I was like: is there? is there thunder in the, in a snowstorm? that's kind of weird. but then I like see it in the window like sliding off of the roof, which is crazy. then it piles up around the door and then then it I gotta shovel it. but then, last but not least, the fun fact: uh, I lied to you all. uh, the the zero, that sounds silly. the zero dollar power bill is actually kind of a lie, because my power company ruined it. every month for the past 12 months my electricity bill has been 5.75. that's just because I have zeroed out all the charges thanks to that metering. but they charge 575 every month basically just to have an account. so thanks, guys. so let's just to wrap everything up here, my one year conclusion: uh, this is an awesome piece of bleeding edge Tech. you can tell it's bleeding edge because it's still rapidly evolving over time and it's still very expensive. so for early adopters like me who are willing to take the plunge, willing to take that risk a little bit, it can be really awesome. it kind of reminds me of electric cars. there are a lot more affordable solar setups out there that are making a meaningful difference for a lot of people in a lot of different situations all over the world. there's also much more massive, huge solar setups as well, but I think we can kind of all get behind a technology making more sustainable energy, more useful, more efficient and More Beautiful over time. I definitely learned a lot with this process, mostly in like how much electricity certain things specifically use, but also how much electricity a roof with solar panels on it can collect in different times of year, different seasons and different situations. but I don't think, honestly. I don't think I would change a thing. I don't think I would change anything in what I did. I've been probably waiting like six months to get a little more of a federal tax credit. but I'll hit one last thing. it was briefly mentioned in like a Tesla earnings call. I think it was that, uh, or maybe Elon just said it randomly- but that Tesla vehicles in a year or two, by 2025, would all support bi-directional charging, which would be amazing. I don't know that that's actually going to happen, but having the cars be able to not just charge other cars but even potentially serve as your House's backup battery would be pretty incredible. these car batteries, as we're learning, are already way bigger and can support way more power output than any power wall, any home battery. one model S battery is equivalent to like seven or eight power walls. so who knows if Tesla actually does or not? but as of today, with the right box on the wall, with the right inverter, the F-150 Lightning, which has an even bigger battery, can actually be your House's backup battery. so I think the number of EVS that support this feature should only be slowly going up. but I think ideally, there's a world in the future where, instead of needing, like a huge, no- the current thing, needing a big solar setup and all these fancy batteries, all you really need is a small solar OA, an inverter and your car battery and you have of the ability to be completely functional during any extended power outage or any emergency. because we live in a world where there's another news story every week about the electrical grid being taxed and how these heat waves are running people's grids and air conditioners into the ground and too much of it is causing blackouts and literally actually deaths. so any strain that we can take off the grid is a win, and anything we can do to operate on clean, sustainable energy is a win for everybody. so thanks for watching. I'll hang out in the comments for a while, but feel free to subscribe if you enjoyed videos like this and the amount of work that goes into these videos on any kind of bleeding edge Tech and stuff like this in the future, and let me know what you're interested in seeing next in the comments. alright, catch you guys in the next one foreign."}, {"title": "Samsung Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5

That's all that's new.\nNew cover screen, new chip, new hinge.\nEverything else,\neverything else from the\ncameras to the battery\nto the charging speed to the crease,\nthe speakers, the inside screen\nis all the same as last year,\nexcept the base storage\nbecause the $1,000 starting price\nnow will get you 256 gigs\nof storage instead of 128.\nThat's good to see.\nSo then the Z Fold 5, the big dog,\nactually has even less new here.\nSo it also gets the new chip,\nit's also got Gorilla Glass Victus 2,\nand it also has a new hinge.\nAnd I don't think that\nshould be underrated.\nLike, that's clearly one\nof the most important parts\nof a folding phone,\nso the fact that it\nnow is slightly thinner\nand slightly more durable\nand folds completely flat,\nall of that is thanks to the\nhinge and that's all sweet.\nBut then also,\nthe inside display is now\nactually much brighter.\nIt gets up to 1,750 nits,\nwhich is dramatically\nbetter than last year,\nwhich was 1,000 nits, so that's awesome.\nAnd then, yeah, that's it.\nLike, the outside screen\nis the same tall 6.2-inch cover display.\nThe triple camera system on the back\nappears to be exactly the same hardware.\nThe under-display\n4-megapixel selfie camera\nhidden in the big display\nis also exactly the same.\nThe battery size is the same,\nthe charging speeds are the same,\nit's IPX8 water resistant again.\nThere is a new S Pen. I'll say this.\nThe S Pen for Fold is now 40%\nthinner than the last one.\nIt still doesn't go inside the phone\nlike a S23 Ultra or a Galaxy Note used to,\nbut at least if you wanna\ncarry it alongside the phone\nin that little case they made for it,\nit'll stick out way less\nbecause it's this flat shape.\nAnd there are some software improvements,\nlike a few more optimized apps,\nyou know, like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube,\nwhen the screen is open or halfway open.\nAnd the improved task bar at the bottom\ncan now show up to four\nof your most recent apps,\nwhich, I guess that goes\npretty hard for multitasking.\nBut, you know, I believe these things\ncan also make it to the last gen Fold.\nAll that being said,\nthat phone's also gonna\nstart at the same price\nas last year, $1,799.\nI saw all this stuff,\nand Samsung told me about the phones,\nand I was thinking about\nit for a little bit,\nand I guess I kind of\ncame to the conclusion\nthat this is just the Samsung way.\nIt's not like they're\ngetting lazy or something,\nlike it's a small, minor update,\nand that's all Samsung ever does anymore.\nBut it's more just,\nthis is on this state\nof foldables in general\nand where Samsung sits in that space.\nSo I made a video like a year\nago on the state of foldables\n'cause we had a bunch of them coming out,\nand I'll leave a link below\nif you wanna watch it,\nbut basically the conclusion I came to\nis there are three form factors\nthat we've been settling on,\nwhich is the Flips, the\nFolds, and the others.\nAnd so my theory on the way\nSamsung operates in this space\nis, basically, they're so settled\ninto these two form factors\nand being safe with these\nand churning along with them\nthat any drastic change, any\nmajor change that I would want\nwould actually probably\njust be a new phone.\nLike, okay, think about this.\nIn the past, we've typically seen Samsung\njust throw stuff at the wall\njust to see what sticks.\nThey're not afraid to have\n1,000 different phones\nin their lineup.\nThey practically invented big phones.\nDo you remember the Samsung Galaxy Mega?\nThis is gonna sound crazy,\nbut one day, Samsung decided\nto just make a gigantic phone.\nCompared to what else was out,\nit looked like this next to\nnormal phones at the time.\nBut sure enough, over\nthe years, guess what?\nWe kind of settled into that form factor,\nand that 6.3-inch Galaxy Mega today\nwould be a pretty\nnormal-sized flagship phone.\nYou remember the Galaxy Note Edge?\nEight years ago, Samsung\ntried curving the display\nover the edge of the side of the phone\nwhen no one else had\nreally done that before,\nand now they've been settling\ninto that sort of thing ever since.\nSame deal with the Note and styluses.\nSo as I hold the new Z Fold 5,\nyeah, it's super similar\nto last year's phone,\nwhich was a really good phone,\nbut the thing is now that I've\nheld some of these others,\nlike the OPPO and\nespecially the Pixel Fold,\nI am struck by how tall and narrow\nSamsung's outside cover screen is.\nIt doesn't feel nearly as\nnatural as the Pixel Fold.\nAnd I don't really enjoy typing on it\nor watching content on a display\nthat's so tall and\nawkwardly shaped either.\nBut for whatever reason,\nit feels like Samsung\nis so set on settling in\nand just iterating on\nthese two form factors\nthat they've already made.\nSo if they were to decide, \"Oh, yeah,\nwe should make, like, a more\npassport-shaped foldable,\"\nI think they'd just make\na whole nother phone.\nSo there's a bunch of other smaller things\nI was really hoping to see in this update,\nlike an improvement on the\nunder-display selfie camera\nthat I've been talking\nabout on the inside screen.\nBut this appears to be literally\nthe exact same hardware,\nso you're still gonna\nhave some heavy processing\nand some rough image quality there.\nIt would've been nice to see\nthe improved back cameras\nget closer to the flagship\nstatus of the S23 series,\nbut they're also using the same sensors\nback there again as well, which were fine.\nA bigger capacity battery\nwould've been cool to see\nto match the Pixel Fold\nor even a slot where\nthe new super slim S Pen\nmaybe could've been\nstored inside the phone.\nThat would've been legitimately\nvery impressive innovation.\nBut still, even leaving\nso many of these things\nliterally the same as last year,\ncollectively, it's still\ngonna be a pretty safe phone.\nAs far as folding phones\nthat you can buy right now,\nthis one's still gonna be really good.\nThere's also some other\nhardware, by the way,\nat this announcement.\nSamsung did this whole Unpacked event.\nThere's some incremental\nimprovements on the watches\nwith bigger screens

Peace.\n(upbeat music)\n", "punctuated_text": "- So this is the brand-new Z Fold 5 and the Z Flip 5.. This is what it looks like when Samsung settles. I'll explain (upbeat music). So welcome to your first look at Samsung's newest generation of foldables. They look very similar to last year. Matter of fact, you probably didn't even realize that this is last year's phone. So Samsung makes two foldables right now. There's the Z Flip 5 and the Z Fold 5.. Same exact shape and dimensions as last year, same aspect ratios, same cameras, same batteries. It would actually be faster for me to just tell you everything that's different, so that's exactly what I'm gonna do. So I'll start with the Flip 5, the more interesting one. It gets an upgrade to the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip that's been both powerful and efficient in the S23 series, and it gets a new and improved hinge that's smaller in every dimension and actually has less moving parts. It's simpler, which should help with everyday durability, and it now allows the phone to fold completely flat. I don't really see or feel any difference with the crease on the other side. It's, you know, still the same tech that we've been using on the screen for a few years now. It's just the fact that Samsung has gotten rid of the gaps so it folds down a little bit smaller, a little thinner and is less likely to catch any dust or debris on the inside, because it's flat. But the main upgrade is definitely the larger outside screen. So this is something that's slowly, steadily, been getting bigger and bigger with each generation. The Z Flip 4,, you might remember, had the biggest yet. That was a 1.9-inch cover display. This one is graduating up to a 3.4-inch Flex window that goes almost from corner to corner, 'cause you know you gotta name everything. It's very clearly not quite as bold as what Motorola did with the Razr Plus, which is this crazy. it's actually corner to corner, basically, and there's like cutouts for the cameras, which it's pretty sick. It's very visually striking, But the idea is the same, which is that it's giving you more readable, glanceable information and making it more usable before you even open it. So as the size of the outside display has expanded, so has the size of the dozen-plus widgets that work on the outside screen, showing you everything from clocks and timers to notifications and messages. There's also a new pinch gesture to zoom out and it'll show you all of the widget screens you have enabled, which is kind of smart, Kind of feels smart, watch-ish, But anyway, the new screen is also covered in Gorilla Glass Victus 2, as well as the back of the phone. And that's it. That's all. that's new: New cover screen, new chip, new hinge, Everything else, everything else, from the cameras to the battery, to the charging speed, to the crease, the speakers. the inside screen is all the same as last year, except the base storage, because the $1,000 starting price now will get you 256 gigs of storage instead of 128. That's good to see. So then the Z Fold 5,, the big dog, actually has even less new here. So it also gets the new chip, it's also got Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and it also has a new hinge, And I don't think that should be underrated, Like that's clearly one of the most important parts of a folding phone. so the fact that it now is slightly thinner and slightly more durable and folds completely flat, all of that is thanks to the hinge, and that's all sweet. But then also, the inside display is now actually much brighter. It gets up to 1,750 nits, which is dramatically better than last year, which was 1,000 nits. so that's awesome. And then, yeah, that's it. Like. the outside screen is the same tall 6.2-inch cover display, The triple camera system on the back appears to be exactly the same hardware. The under-display 4-megapixel selfie camera hidden in the big display is also exactly the same. The battery size is the same. the charging speeds are the same. it's IPX8 water resistant. again. There is a new S Pen. I'll say this. The S Pen for Fold is now 40% thinner than the last one. It still doesn't go inside the phone like a S23 Ultra or a Galaxy Note used to, but at least if you wanna carry it alongside the phone in that little case they made for it, it'll stick out way less because it's this flat shape. And there are some software improvements, like a few more optimized apps, you know, like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube. when the screen is open or halfway open And the improved task bar at the bottom can now show up to four of your most recent apps, which I guess that goes pretty hard for multitasking. But you know, I believe these things can also make it to the last gen Fold. All that being said, that phone's also gonna start at the same price as last year: $1,799..

But for whatever reason, it feels like Samsung is so set on settling in and just iterating on these two form factors that they've already made. So if they were to decide: \"Oh yeah, we should make like a more passport-shaped foldable\". I think they'd just make a whole nother phone.

As far as folding phones that you can buy right now, this one's still gonna be really good. There's also some other hardware. by the way. at this announcement, Samsung did this whole Unpacked event. There's some incremental improvements on the watches with bigger screens and thinner rotating bezels that are super sweet, And the new S9 series of tablets. they just got the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip as well, And I still just love the S9 Ultra so much. What a ridiculous, awesome, gigantic tablet with a 14-1/2-inch 120-hertz display, just a razor-thin, monster media device. I'm just glad this exists. so just wanted to shout that out. But that's all we've got for now. I'm super curious to hear what you guys actually think of Samsung keeping especially the $1,800 folding phone price and not really changing much. but let me know Till the next one.

separately so\nwe'll just call these beats headphones\nbut these are their new 350 over-ear\nnoise canceling headphones it's right in\nthat premium tier of like you could get\nthe Sony Mark fives or you could get the\nBose qc45s and these kind of slot right\nin alongside those I just I want you to\nlisten to all the ways that these new\nbeats are actually just straight up\nbetter than Apple's Flagship airpods Max\nso first of all with the design even\nthough they're not metal everywhere I\nwould actually argue build quality is\nnicely done and will actually be\nprobably preferred by most people over\nthe airpods max most headphones are\nplastic for a reason and in this case\nthat means they are much lighter than\nthe airpods and the ear cups are still\nquite soft they're very flexible\ncomfortable pair of headphones to wear\nfor a long time for like a flight or\nsomething like that and then they\nactually fold up so they're much easier\nto travel with and they fold into this\nactually reasonable case with pockets\nfor cables and even this little zippered\npouch inside for well I actually don't\nknow what that pocket is for maybe\nanother cable but whatever it's there if\nyou want it and that's a huge win for\nthese for just daily practicality and\nusability over this basically the\noverall design is honestly you can tell\nalready it's very similar to the\nprevious generation from a few years ago\nit's got the physical music controls on\nthe left ear cup and a power button with\na set of battery indicator lights which\nis nice on the right but it's also a bit\nmore tame like it's a bit cleaner all\nthe way around like they've removed some\nof the shiny the Chrome bits and the the\nBeats branding that used to be a little\nmore obvious like the text that used to\nbe on top of the headphones that's now\ngone the only downside I could really\nfind is these darker matte colors really\npick up fingerprints like extremely\neasily and they're hard to clean and\nthen the shallower ear cup might be a\nlittle more fatiguing it doesn't feel\nquite like on-ear headphones but they're\nkind of right in between on-ear and over\near so the mesh on the inside is\nactually touching your ear otherwise\nyeah I'd say these beats the design is\ndare I say classy then there's uh the\nheadphone jack on the left side another\nthing airpods Max doesn't have and it\nalso does come with a nice little I\nthink this is a three foot aux cable so\nif you're plugging into your Source\nthese headphones will do that and on the\nother side the right side a USBC Port\nnot a lightning port and through that\nUSBC again the most an apple-like thing\nwith these you can plug it comes with\nthis USBC to C cable it's kind of short\nbut I don't know maybe two three feet\nbut you can plug directly into your\nsource for lossless compressed audio so\nI can plug this into my pixel it charges\nthem and that's the highest bitrate\naudio that these can achieve which of\ncourse won't happen with an iPhone\nbecause that's a lightning Port they\nhave longer battery life than the\nairpods max they're rated for 40 hours\nwith noise cancellation off and 24 hours\nwith ANC on plus fast charging will get\nyou like four hours of listening and 10\nminutes being plugged in and the cherry\non top is there like two hundred dollars\ncheaper I think if we stopped right here\nthis would be the best Apple headphones\never made certainly the best beats ever\nmade\num but we can't stop right here because\nthese headphones do have a few\ninteresting\nhow do I say quirks about them a few\nquirks so first of all there is no on\nhead detection which isn't necessarily\nsomething I care about but in the world\nof all the other 350 over ear noise\ncanceling headphones out there they\npretty much all have it so it was kind\nof interesting to see that these don't\nbut then even more interesting these\nlack any Apple chip so these don't have\nany H1 or H2 chip in them which to be\nfair is also true about you know the\nSony's and the bows of the world\nbut this is made by Apple and previous\nBeats headphones have literally already\nhad the H chip in them so it's just kind\nof weird that these just don't have it\nsuddenly so what does that mean to not\nhave a chip well there's still Bluetooth\nheadphones Bluetooth 5.3 actually and\nthey still fast pair to an iPhone and\ninstantly show up in your iCloud so\nthey're available across any of the\ndevices in your account that's still\ngreat it's on your phone your iPad your\nMac all that right away but they cannot\ndo the instant switching back and forth\nbecause they don't have multi-point\nconnectivity so that like magic moment\nwhere like you're listening to music on\nyour computer and then you get a phone\ncall on your iPhone and you accept it\nand instantly you're now listening to\nthe phone call on the same headphones\nthis won't do that you'll have to take a\nfew Taps and go through bluetooth\nsettings and switch which one it's\npaired to it's not quite as seamless and\nthen there's some also smaller things\nlike there's no wake and instant pair\nactually they're just kind of always on\nuntil you turn them off which can be a\nbummer if you forget to turn them off\nand then they're just sitting around\ndraining the battery and then the\ntransparency mode which is new to these\nisn't quite as good as airpods and I\nknow that's like the highest bar\npossible\num and I don't know exactly how much of\nthat is the chip and the processing on\nthe H chips versus the actual\nmicrophones but what I do know is the\nairpods have a superior amazing\ntransparency mode and these are just a\nnotch Behind still fine still fine it's\njust a little more dull a little more\nprocessed and muted sounding these\nheadphones also do have spatial audio\nthey can do the head tracking spatial\naudio if you're into that and they also\nshow up in find my on the iPhone but\nhuge but they don't stay always like\nsort of pinging in the background on the\nfind my network because they don't have\nthat H chip so when they show up in find\nmy they just show up in the last place\nthat they were on and connected so if I\nwere to go on a trip somewhere and like\nfold these up and turn them off and put\nthem on my backpack and go travel and\nthen I lose my bag and I'm like ah I\ngotta find my headphones\nit's just going to show me on the map\nthe last place that I had them on and\nturn them off\nwhich is not really that helpful now on\nthe grand scheme of things maybe these\nare more luxury features than absolute\nNecessities you could certainly argue\nbut again you're paying in the realm of\nluxury headphones like you being able to\nseparate these with ecosystem plug\nfeatures like that's exactly what I\nwould expect Apple to do which is why\nit's almost funny that they didn't all\nthat being said I'm happy to say this is\na pair of Beats that I would be totally\nhappy living with like for my Android\npeople out there they have fast pair\nwith Android as well and they actually\ndo automatically add it to all of your\nChrome devices so if you have a\nChromebook that works great same deal\nfor find my it works when they're on but\nit just shows the point of last\nconnection and it will let you mess with\nall the same settings as the iPhone if\nyou just grab the Beats app then you\njust get that same UI so as far as sound\nquality\nlook yes they are a v-shaped equalizer\nwith strong bass and not that great mids\nbut it's fine it's not dramatic it's not\nterrible it's actually fun I think for a\nlot of different genres of music and\nwatching movies and videos and even\npodcasts and phone calls and things like\nthat it is completely fine and I mean\nI'd never edit videos with these or\nanything but hey not bad for fun\nheadphones just know that if you're\nafter a more neutral flat EQ like you're\nprobably never considering these to\nbegin with and that's also totally fine\nbut then here's the last Quirk here's\nthe last kind of a interesting feature\nwith these headphones there is\ntechnically an EQ\nbut only when you are plugged into the\nsource via USB type c so you've got this\nC2C cable I can plug into a pixel plug\ninto whatever and then you're getting\nyour lossless audio and then and only\nthen can you switch between uh there are\nthree built-in EQ profiles so to change\nthem you plug everything in and press\nthe power button twice that switches you\nbetween the signature profile which is\nthe default entertainment profile which\nis a little more dramatic with bright\nhighs and a huge boomy bass and then a\nconversation profile which really boosts\nthe frequencies of human voices that's\nbasically just for phone calls or\nlistening to podcasts there's like no\nbass at all and they have these little\nlight codes too that indicate which mode\nyou are in so you can get the most out\nof these new 40 millimeter drivers in\nthese Apple headphones by plugging in\nvia USB type c\nand then going with losses audio and\nswapping between three baked in firmware\ncoded EQ settings\nwild do I wish there was more do I wish\nI could actually just like pull up a\ngraph and untoggle and make my own\ncustom EQ myself yeah\ndo I also realize that most beats\ncustomers would never dig in that far to\nbegin with\nalso yes but the microphone quality is\nalso solid the Bluetooth latency is\nfairly minimal very easy to watch videos\nand play games with them and there is\ntechnically no IP rating it doesn't say\nit's water resistant anywhere but I\nwould wager if I was betting that these\nare probably going to be okay as gym\nheadphones you can probably sweat in\nthese and it'd be similar to previous\nbeats that's not an official IP rating\nthat's just me going and the way it's\nbuilt feels like they'd be okay so well\nplayed Apple slash beats these aren't\ncomplete enough to completely\ncannibalize airpods Max but they for\npeople on the know they are very very\ngood and almost complete enough and much\ncheaper enough to be basically a really\ngood alternative and I fully expect to\nstart seeing these on flights a lot\nbecause these are going to be really\nsolid fun entertaining headphones\nit also seems like beats and apple just\ndon't talk\nI wonder what's up with that either way\nthat's been it thanks for watching catch\nyou guys in the next one toothpaste\n[Music]\n", "punctuated_text": "okay, these headphones actually have the chance to be the best Apple headphones ever made by a mile. they're basically be like airpods Max, but lighter, weight, actually folding, with a better case, with USBC and a longer battery life and cheaper. so yeah, of course there's a catch. [Music] up. I'm kbhd here. I have a feeling that most people just don't think about the fact that they kind of maybe forgot that Apple owns Beats, like they bought beats for billions of dollars and own and run them as a company. now- and that's one of the craziest things about these headphones is, if you took the Beats logo and just erase it from the side of these headphones and replace it with an Apple logo, these would be insane that they're just so unapple-like. but instead they just seem to operate super separately. so we'll just call these beats headphones. but these are their new 350 over-ear noise canceling headphones. it's right in that premium tier of like you could get the Sony Mark fives or you could get the Bose qc45s and these kind of slot right in alongside those. I just I want you to listen to all the ways that these new beats are actually just straight up, better than Apple's Flagship airpods Max. so first of all, with the design. even though they're not metal everywhere, I would actually argue build quality is nicely done and will actually be probably preferred by most people over the airpods max. most headphones are plastic for a reason and in this case that means they are much lighter than the airpods and the ear cups are still quite soft. they're very flexible, comfortable pair of headphones to wear for a long time for like a flight or something like that, and then they actually fold up so they're much easier to travel with. and they fold into this actually reasonable case with pockets for cables and even this little zippered pouch inside for well, I actually don't know what that pocket is for, maybe another cable, but whatever it's there if you want it. and that's a huge win for these for just daily practicality and usability over this. basically, the overall design is honestly you can tell already it's very similar to the previous generation from a few years ago. it's got the physical music controls on the left ear cup and a power button with a set of battery indicator lights- which is nice- on the right, but it's also a bit more tame, like it's a bit cleaner all the way around, like they've removed some of the shiny, the Chrome bits and the the Beats branding. that used to be a little more obvious, like the text that used to be on top of the headphones. that's now gone. the only downside I could really find is these darker, matte colors really pick up fingerprints like extremely easily and they're hard to clean. and then the shallower ear cup might be a little more fatiguing. it doesn't feel quite like on-ear headphones but they're kind of right in between on-ear and over ear, so the mesh on the inside is actually touching your ear. otherwise, yeah, I'd say these beats. the design is, dare I say, classy. then there's, uh, the headphone jack on the left side, another thing airpods Max doesn't have and it also does come with a nice little. I think this is a three foot aux cable, so if you're plugging into your Source, these headphones will do that. and on the other side, the right side, a USBC Port, not a lightning port, and through that USBC- again the most an apple-like thing with these you can plug. it comes with this USBC to C cable. it's kind of short, but I don't know, maybe two, three feet, but you can plug directly into your source for lossless compressed audio. so I can plug this into my pixel. it charges them and that's the highest bitrate audio that these can achieve, which of course won't happen with an iPhone, because that's a lightning Port. they have longer battery life than the airpods max. they're rated for 40 hours with noise cancellation off and 24 hours with ANC on. plus, fast charging will get you like four hours of listening and 10 minutes being plugged in. and the cherry on top is there like two hundred dollars cheaper. I think if we stopped right here, this would be the best Apple headphones ever made- certainly the best beats ever made, um. but we can't stop right here, because these headphones do have a few interesting- how do I say? quirks about them. a few quirks. so, first of all, there is no on head detection, which isn't necessarily something I care about. but in the world of all the other 350 over ear noise canceling headphones out there, they pretty much all have it. so it was kind of interesting to see that these don't. but then, even more interesting, these lack any Apple chip. so these don't have any H1 or H2 chip in them, which, to be fair, is also true about, you know, the Sony's and the bows of the world. but this is made by Apple, and previous Beats headphones have literally already had the H chip in them. so it's just kind of weird that these just don't have it suddenly. so what does that mean to not have a chip? well, there's still Bluetooth headphones- Bluetooth 5.3 actually- and they still fast pair to an iPhone and instantly show up in your iCloud, so they're available across any of the devices in your account. that's still great. it's on your phone, your iPad, your Mac- all that right away. but they cannot do the instant switching back and forth because they don't have multi-point connectivity so that like magic moment where, like, you're listening to music on your computer and then you get a phone call on your iPhone and you accept it and instantly you're now listening to the phone call on the same headphones. this won't do that. you'll have to take a few Taps and go through bluetooth settings and switch which one it's paired to. it's not quite as seamless. and then there's some also smaller things like there's no wake and instant pair. actually they're just kind of always on until you turn them off, which can be a bummer if you forget to turn them off, and then they're just sitting around draining the battery. and then the transparency mode, which is new to these, isn't quite as good as airpods and I know that's like the highest bar possible, um, and I don't know exactly how much of that is the chip and the processing on the H chips versus the actual microphones. but what I do know is the airpods have a superior, amazing transparency mode and these are just a notch Behind. still fine, still fine. it's just a little more dull, a little more processed and muted sounding. these headphones also do have spatial audio. they can do the head tracking spatial audio if you're into that. and they also show up in find my on the iPhone, but huge. but they don't stay always like sort of pinging in the background on the find my network because they don't have that H chip. so when they show up in find my, they just show up in the last place that they were on and connected. so if I were to go on a trip somewhere and like fold these up and turn them off and put them on my backpack and go travel and then I lose my bag and I'm like, ah, I gotta find my headphones, it's just going to show me on the map the last place that I had them on and turn them off, which is not really that helpful. now, on the grand scheme of things. maybe these are more luxury features than absolute Necessities, you could certainly argue, but again, you're paying in the realm of luxury headphones like you being able to separate these with ecosystem plug features like that's exactly what I would expect Apple to do, which is why it's almost funny that they didn't. all that being said, I'm happy to say this is a pair of Beats that I would be totally happy living with. like for my Android people out there, they have fast pair with Android as well and they actually do automatically add it to all of your Chrome devices. so if you have a Chromebook, that works, great. same deal for find my. it works when they're on, but it just shows the point of last connection and it will let you mess with all the same settings as the iPhone. if you just grab the Beats app, then you just get that same UI. so as far as sound quality look, yes, they are a v-shaped equalizer with strong bass and not that great mids, but it's fine. it's not dramatic, it's not terrible, it's actually fun, I think, for a lot of different genres of music and watching movies and videos and even podcasts and phone calls and things like that. it is completely fine and I mean I'd never edit videos with these or anything, but hey, not bad for fun. headphones. just know that if you're after a more neutral, flat EQ, like you're probably never considering these to begin with, and that's also totally fine. but then here's the last Quirk, here's the last kind of a interesting feature with these headphones. there is technically an EQ, but only when you are plugged into the source via USB type c. so you've got this C2C cable I can plug into a pixel, plug into whatever, and then you're getting your lossless audio. and then, and only then, can you switch between. uh, there are three built-in EQ profiles, so to change them you plug everything in and press the power button twice. that switches you between the signature profile, which is the default, entertainment profile, which is a little more dramatic, with bright highs and a huge boomy bass, and then a conversation profile, which really boosts the frequencies of human voices. that's basically just for phone calls or listening to podcasts. there's like no bass at all. and they have these little light codes too that indicate which mode you are in. so you can get the most out of these new 40 millimeter drivers in these Apple headphones by plugging in via USB type c and then going with losses audio and swapping between three baked in firmware coded EQ settings wild. do I wish there was more? do I wish I could actually just like pull up a graph and untoggle and make my own custom EQ myself? yeah, do I also realize that most beats customers would never dig in that far to begin with? also, yes, but the microphone quality is also solid. the Bluetooth latency is fairly minimal, very easy to watch videos and play games with them and there is technically no IP rating. it doesn't say it's water resistant anywhere, but I would wager, if I was betting, that these are probably going to be okay as gym headphones. you can probably sweat in these and it'd be similar to previous beats. that's not an official IP rating, that's just me going, and the way it's built feels like they'd be okay. so well played Apple slash beats. these aren't complete enough to completely cannibalize airpods Max, but they, for people on the know, they are very, very good and almost complete enough and much cheaper enough to be basically a really good alternative and I fully expect to start seeing these on flights a lot because these are going to be really solid, fun, entertaining headphones. it also seems like beats and apple just don't talk.

internet for a long\ntime and most of it\nat least where I hang out pretty\nreasonable which is great but you know\nthere are some tucked away in the\ncorners every once in a while that do\nhave some pretty controversial opinions\nthings that they actually believe in\nsome hot takes that are guaranteed to\nruffle some feathers\nbut sometimes there is some truth to\nthem so today I've gathered some of the\nhottest takes from around the internet\nfrom you guys and we're gonna see\nthey're actually good takes or not also\nI need to thank Jimmy hyrueller for the\nconcept for this video if you haven't\nalready seen his channel he does a lot\nof basketball videos including reacting\nto NBA hot takes they're incredible so\nif you somehow if you're interested in\nbasketball and somehow haven't seen this\nchannel already I'll link it below but\nuh let's get into some tech hot takes so\nhere's a hot take Tesla cyber truck will\noutsell the Ford F-150 by 2026 and this\nwell this is a hot one so the Cyber\ntruck the Cyber truck is one of the most\nhyped vehicles in a long time as long as\nI've been alive certainly the most hyped\nEV you know the numbers speak for\nthemselves but now they're actually\nbeing spotted around the roads around\nTesla headquarters and it seems like\nthey're finishing up details of\nmanufacturing and design and they may be\nabout to finally go into production with\nthis thing now the hot take is that\nit'll outsell the F-150 in three years\nbecause the F-150 as you may already\nknow is very popular but the thing is\nI don't know if you thought about this\nis you're typing it I don't know if you\nrealize how popular the F-150 actually\nis the Ford F-150 has been America's\nbest-selling truck for 46 years in a row\nactually it's been the number one most\npopular vehicle for 41 years straight\nlast year Ford sold one of these trucks\nevery 49 seconds and it typically totals\nanywhere from 600 000 to just under a\nmillion of these things every single\ncalendar year so yeah the Cyber truck\nvery hyped and there are allegedly\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of one and\na half million pre-orders which is crazy\nfor a vehicle that's not even out yet\nthat only a handful of people have even\nseen with their eyes but a couple of\nthings first of all those pre-orders are\n100\ndeposits I know that because I'm one of\nthem I think they're actually hundred\ndollar refundable deposits the point\nbeing one and a half million pre-orders\ndoes not not equal one and a half\nmillion sales it's just it's just that\nmany people have reserved their spot in\nline and some fraction of them will\nconvert to orders but it won't be a\nhundred percent and Tesla knows that but\nthen number two you can't just build\nthem all at once you have to ramp up\ninto production we've seen this with\nother models before so you know they'll\nstart off small a couple dozen one week\nthen a hundred the next week then 500\nthe next week and they'll have to ramp\nup it'll take a while to get through the\nfirst million easily well over a year\nlike at this very moment Tesla doesn't\neven have the capacity to make a million\nmodel threes let alone a million of\nsomething they've never made before so\nyou know we could we could be optimistic\nabout the manufacturing process but it\nis it's going to be tough to get to a\nmillion of these things sold and\ndethroning the King by 2026. so I love\nthe optimism about that cyber truck\npossibly being one of the most\ndisruptive vehicles ever maybe could\nhappen but it's going to take a little\nmore time than that\nbad take all right here's another one\nthat Apple Maps is now better than\nGoogle Maps and this is this is a\ninteresting take do you remember when\nApple Maps first came out like all the\nthe horror stories the articles that all\ncame out how bad it was there were\nentire towns missing there were places\nthat were just in the wrong spot it was\ngetting people lost driving them into\nwater it was it was missing a ton of\nfeatures it was so bad that Tim Cook the\nCEO had to issue an apology but\na lot of things have changed since then\nbasically I mean having a good maps app\nrequires a lot of mapping data so\nthey've been plugging away at that since\nthat launch of course all the street\nview data the correct location data\nbusinesses public transportation\ndifferent actual routes real-time\ntraffic all that stuff they've improved\ndramatically at all of that plus they've\nactually started adding some genuinely\ncool features on top of it I can\nactually vouch that if you look at\nGoogle Street View and apple map Street\nView in the same location nine times out\nof ten the Apple Maps one is actually\nhigher quality and smoother and looks\nbetter it's easier to navigate I also\nthink Apple Maps is generally better\ndesigned it's just a little better\nlooking than Google Maps and as of the\nlatest IOS 17 beta it's actually finally\ngetting one of the biggest features that\nwas missing which is downloading maps\nfor offline finally I'm not ready to say\nthat Apple Maps is better than Google\nMaps yet I mean espe actually because\nfirst of all it's multi-platform it's\njust so much more available and then the\ndecades-long Head Start that Google's\nhad in mapping and gathering information\nin the most obscure parts of the world\nlike it's going to take some time for\nApple to continue to catch up with that\nbut I will say that it's at least\ncaught up to Google Maps they're on the\nsame level they're actually competitors\nwhich is good because now they compete\nto try to get better and for certain\npeople in some places sometimes it's\njust as good if not better than Google\nMaps there I said it\nI said it\nit's a good take the Magic Mouse is the\nbest Mouse\nfor the Mac\nyou know y'all are really pushing this\none I\nlet's just ignore the take for a second\nand just talk about them how does the\nMagic Mouse exist like how is this the\nbest mouse that Apple the world's\nrichest three trillion dollar company\ncould come up with well over billions of\ndollars of research and development\ndollars and the best designers in the\nworld and all the testing and\noptimizations and strategy on the planet\nthis is the best mouse that they could\ncome up with seriously sorry I should I\nshould be more objective here what makes\na good Mouse\nzoom out a little bit good design good\nperformance good features good price\nthe best Mouse cannot have a fatal flaw\nin more than one of these fundamental\ncategories and we all know about the\nfact that the only way to charge it is a\nlightning port and they put that port at\nthe bottom of the mouse so you literally\ncan't even use it while you're waiting\nfor it to charge it might only happen\nonce a month but that's more than it\nshould ever happen but on top of that\nit's also terrible ergonomically I mean\nthere's a reason why all the other best\nmice in the world have an arch to rest\nyour hand but look older is a smart guy\nI don't think he's trolling this is not\na completely empty take\nthe reason why people genuinely feel\nthis way about the Magic Mouse is\nbecause Apple has done to this accessory\nwhat they've done to every other\naccessory that they possibly can in\ntheir Universe which is making it\nimpossible to make a better one than the\napple one like you literally cannot make\na better smart watch for the iPhone\nbecause you'll never get as much access\nto the data and the integration that\nApple gives its own watch you can\nliterally never make headphones that\npair more fluidly and switch more easily\nthan Apple's own airpods and the Magic\nMouse\nwell the Magic Mouse has smooth\nscrolling literally the best and only\ngood feature about the Magic Mouse is\nthat it has really smooth scrolling end\ngestures so you can scroll up and down\nwith one finger and it just flows with\nthe inertia of a touch screen like you\ncan toss web pages and apps around and\ncatch them with this smooth scrolling\nyou can two finger swipe between spaces\nyou can zoom in and out of things it's\njust so smooth just like a mouse should\nbe and every single other Mouse for Mac\nScrolls in jittery chunks basically\nbecause they literally have to just pick\nan integer for how many lines they want\nto scroll with every unit scrolled on\nthe scroll wheel it's just night and day\ndifference there's just no way for it to\nbe as smooth now this is also true about\nthe magic Trackpad which is actually why\nI literally use one on my desk alongside\na good Mouse and I know plenty of people\nwho just use a trackpad and no mouse at\nall so if you list if you really listen\nto people who defend the Magic Mouse\nyou'll typically hear something along\nthe lines of well except for insert\ngiant flaw here it's a great Mouse and\nexcept for comfortableness it's it's\namazing except for the whole charging on\nthe bottom thing which you only do once\nin a while it's great\nthat's a pretty big thing for a mouse I\nmean there's really not much that they\nhave to get right the Apple the Magic\nMouse is one of the most frustrating\nApple products\nbecause it just it could be so good that\nit they could with their trillions of\ndollars they could just hire a building\nfull of the best Mouse designers on the\nplanet they could they could buy\nwhatever people they want to design the\nmost incredible Mouse mankind has ever\nseen and it could have smooth scrolling\nbut they don't do it\nthey don't do it\nI knew this was coming\nit's a bad take tensor sucks and Google\nshould have stuck with Snapdragon I I\ncan get behind half of this take not the\nwhole thing but I can get behind half of\nthis tensor\nIs Not Great you know like two years ago\nGoogle made this bold choice to move\nfrom Qualcomm Snapdragon chips in their\nphones to their own custom designed\ntensor chip that's actually built by\nSamsung and the idea was to be able to\ndedicate certain parts of the chip to\ncertain functions whether AI related or\njust you know specific to the phone\nspeech to text things like that we are\ntwo generations in now so we're at\ntensor G2 in the pixel and they have\nrelatively weak raw performance\nand they also don't have great battery\nlife and they're not very efficient so I\nget why people say tensor sucks but\nI don't think they should have stuck\nwith Snapdragon I still think there's\ntime I still think in two or three\ngenerations even they could get to the\npoint where they have such good\noptimization and such good calibration\nwith exactly what they want to do with\nthese chips that they'll be the most\nefficient best battery life best\nexperience something that they could\nnever have created by just buying an\noff-the-shelf bunch of Snapdragon ships\nso I think today like if today they\nliterally offered a Snapdragon Google\npixel with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and a\ntensor G2 I think today I would pick the\nSnapdragon one but I don't think they\nshould just give up on the tensor dream\nokay take all right beats R and have\nalways been very good often people\npretend that sound isn't incredibly\nsubjective a natural audiophilic sound\nis always less enjoyable and more\njarring outside of pro referencing you\nknow\nyou bring up a really good point\naudio is subjective audio is definitely\nsubjective now back in the days of uh\nmaking fun of Beats headphones for being\noverpriced garbage sounding plastic\nthere was always uh a little a little\nkernel of Truth Underneath It All which\nis that people still bought beats all\nthe time and enjoyed them and I always\nfound that fascinating that you could\nliterally tell people that there there's\nanother pair of headphones out there\nthat sounds better for half the money\nand people in that world where it seems\nlike a totally straightforward choice\nthey would still pick the beats and love\nthem and recommend them and the truth is\nlike yeah for most people if you just\ngive them like their their first pair of\nnice headphones their first pair of\nexpensive headphones and they've got\nthis nice v-shaped equalizer a big\nthumping bass and they're not really\nthinking too hard about it being nice\nand flat and a nice professional sound\nthey're going to be impressed it's going\nto sound really exciting and interesting\nfor most music listening which is what\npeople are doing with Beats headphones\nit's great it's fine like audio is it\nreally is one of the most subjective\nthings in all of the tech world and\nthere are tons of reviews and studies\nout there with countless examples of\nthis it kind of feels like the only\ntrait in audio that people universally\nfind impressive is just loudness just\nhigher volume but kind of across the\nboard anyone can kind of enjoy any sound\nsignature and generally headphones these\ndays are good enough to have an EQ and\nbe able to sound differently based on\ndifferent types of music and movies and\nwhatever you're doing now all that being\nsaid I don't think I could still say\nthat beats have always been very good I\nthey've at some point in the past they\nwere definitely a much more expensive\ncheaply built version of the average\nheadphones you could kind of just get\nanywhere else but the marketing team\nhas always been very good that has\nalways been good so I think yeah decent\nheadphones today\ndecent take also side note I continue to\nbe so fascinated by the behavior of them\nas a company like beats since they've\nbeen purchased by Apple and the newest\npair of Beats by Dre Studio Pro\nheadphones are the latest example of\nthat let me know if you guys are\ninterested in a video about these things\nby hitting that like button either way\nthis has been really fun I think we\nshould do this again sometime for sure\nnot doing that one uh so leave your hot\ntakes I say leave them in the comments\nsection below and I'll sort of comb\nthrough those it's not even\nmathematically correct and I'll come\nthrough those and I'll find the best\nones and we'll do another tech hot takes\nvideo in the future have you read my\nshirt this entire video and I think\nthat'll be really fun just make sure\nthey're a little more varied and\ndifferent from this past one I hate this\nI hate this one\n", "punctuated_text": "[Music], [Music], [Music], thank you, thank you. so I've been on the internet for a long time and most of it, at least, where I hang out- pretty reasonable, which is great. but you know, there are some tucked away in the corners every once in a while that do have some pretty controversial opinions, things that they actually believe in, some hot takes that are guaranteed to ruffle some feathers, but sometimes there is some truth to them. so today I've gathered some of the hottest takes from around the internet, from you guys, and we're gonna see they're actually good takes or not. also, I need to thank Jimmy hyrueller for the concept for this video. if you haven't already seen his channel, he does a lot of basketball videos, including reacting to NBA hot takes. they're incredible. so if you somehow, if you're interested in basketball and somehow haven't seen this channel already, I'll link it below. but uh, let's get into some tech hot takes. so here's a hot take: Tesla cyber truck will outsell the Ford F-150 by 2026, and this, well, this is a hot one. so the Cyber truck, the Cyber truck, is one of the most hyped vehicles in a long time- as long as I've been alive, certainly the most hyped EV. you know, the numbers speak for themselves. but now they're actually being spotted around the roads around Tesla headquarters and it seems like they're finishing up details of manufacturing and design and they may be about to finally go into production with this thing. now the hot take is that it'll outsell the F-150 in three years, because the F-150, as you may already know, is very popular. but the thing is, I don't know if you thought about this, is you're typing it? I don't know if you realize how popular the F-150 actually is. the Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling truck for 46 years in a row. actually, it's been the number one most popular vehicle for 41 years straight. last year, Ford sold one of these trucks every 49 seconds and it typically totals anywhere from 600 000 to just under a million of these things every single calendar year. so yeah, the Cyber truck very hyped, and there are allegedly somewhere in the neighborhood of one and a half million pre-orders, which is crazy for a vehicle that's not even out yet, that only a handful of people have even seen with their eyes. but a couple of things. first of all, those pre-orders are 100 deposits. I know that because I'm one of them. I think they're actually hundred dollar refundable deposits, the point being one and a half million pre-orders does not not equal one and a half million sales, it's just. it's just that many people have reserved their spot in line and some fraction of them will convert to orders, but it won't be a hundred percent, and Tesla knows that. but then, number two: you can't just build them all at once. you have to ramp up into production. we've seen this with other models before, so you know they'll start off small, a couple dozen one week, then a hundred the next week, then 500 the next week, and they'll have to ramp up. it'll take a while to get through the first million, easily well over a year. like at this very moment, Tesla doesn't even have the capacity to make a million model threes, let alone a million of something they've never made before. so you know we could, we could be optimistic about the manufacturing process, but it is. it's going to be tough to get to a million of these things sold and dethroning the King by 2026.. so I love the optimism about that cyber truck possibly being one of the most disruptive vehicles ever. maybe could happen, but it's going to take a little more time than that bad take all right. here's another one: that Apple Maps is now better than Google Maps, and this is- this is a interesting take. do you remember when Apple Maps first came out- like all the the horror stories, the articles that all came out- how bad it was? there were entire towns missing, there were places that were just in the wrong spot, it was getting people lost, driving them into water, it was. it was missing a ton of features. it was so bad that Tim Cook, the CEO, had to issue an apology. but a lot of things have changed since then. basically, I mean, having a good maps app requires a lot of mapping data, so they've been plugging away at that since that launch. of course, all the street view data, the correct location data, businesses, public transportation, different actual routes, real-time traffic- all that stuff- they've improved dramatically at all of that. plus, they've actually started adding some genuinely cool features on top of it. I can actually vouch that if you look at Google Street View and apple map- Street View in the same location, nine times out of ten- the Apple Maps one is actually higher quality and smoother and looks better. it's easier to navigate. I also think Apple Maps is generally better designed. it's just a little better looking than Google Maps and, as of the latest IOS 17 beta, it's actually finally getting one of the biggest features that was missing, which is downloading maps for offline. finally, I'm not ready to say that Apple Maps is better than Google Maps yet. I mean espe actually, because first of all, it's multi-platform- it's just so much more available, and then the decades-long Head Start that Google's had in mapping and gathering information in the most obscure parts of the world. like it's going to take some time for Apple to continue to catch up with that. but I will say that it's at least caught up to Google Maps. they're on the same level. they're actually competitors, which is good, because now they compete to try to get better and for certain people in some places sometimes it's just as good, if not better, than Google Maps. there, I said it. I said it, it's a good take. the Magic Mouse is the best Mouse for the Mac. you know y'all are really pushing this one. I let's just ignore the take for a second and just talk about them. how does the Magic Mouse exist like? how is this the best mouse that Apple, the world's richest three trillion dollar company, could come up with? well over billions of dollars of research and development dollars and the best designers in the world and all the testing and optimizations and strategy on the planet, this is the best mouse that they could come up with. seriously, sorry, I should. I should be more objective here. what makes a good Mouse? zoom out a little bit: good design, good performance, good features, good price. the best Mouse cannot have a fatal flaw in more than one of these fundamental categories. and we all know about the fact that the only way to charge it is a lightning port, and they put that port at the bottom of the mouse so you literally can't even use it while you're waiting for it to charge. it might only happen once a month, but that's more than it should ever happen. but on top of that it's also terrible ergonomically. I mean, there's a reason why all the other best mice in the world have an arch to rest your hand. but look older is a smart guy. I don't think he's trolling. this is not a completely empty take. the reason why people genuinely feel this way about the Magic Mouse is because Apple has done to this accessory what they've done to every other accessory that they possibly can in their Universe, which is making it impossible to make a better one than the apple. one like you literally cannot make a better smart watch for the iPhone, because you'll never get as much access to the data and the integration that Apple gives its own watch. you can literally never make headphones that pair more fluidly and switch more easily than Apple's own airpods and the Magic Mouse. well, the Magic Mouse has smooth scrolling. literally the best and only good feature about the Magic Mouse is that it has really smooth scrolling end gestures so you can scroll up and down with one finger and it just flows with the inertia of a touch screen. like you can toss web pages and apps around and catch them. with this smooth scrolling, you can two finger swipe between spaces, you can zoom in and out of things. it's just so smooth, just like a mouse should be, and every single other Mouse for Mac Scrolls in jittery chunks, basically because they literally have to just pick an integer for how many lines they want to scroll. with every unit scrolled on the scroll wheel. it's just night and day difference. there's just no way for it to be as smooth now. this is also true about the magic Trackpad, which is actually why I literally use one on my desk alongside a good Mouse, and I know plenty of people who just use a trackpad and no mouse at all. so if you list, if you really listen to people who defend the Magic Mouse, you'll typically hear something along the lines of: well, except for insert giant flaw here, it's a great Mouse and except for comfortableness, it's. it's amazing. except for the whole charging on the bottom thing, which you only do once in a while, it's great. that's a pretty big thing for a mouse. I mean there's really not much that they have to get right. the Apple the Magic Mouse is one of the most frustrating Apple products because it just it could be so good that it they could with their trillions of dollars. they could just hire a building full of the best Mouse designers on the planet. they could. they could buy whatever people they want to design the most incredible Mouse mankind has ever seen and it could have smooth scrolling. but they don't do it. they don't do it. I knew this was coming. it's a bad take. tensor sucks and Google should have stuck with Snapdragon I. I can get behind half of this take, not the whole thing, but I can get behind half of this. tensor Is Not Great. you know, like two years ago Google made this bold choice to move from Qualcomm Snapdragon chips in their phones to their own custom designed tensor chip. that's actually built by Samsung and the idea was to be able to dedicate certain parts of the chip to certain functions, whether AI related or just, you know, specific to the phone speech, to text, things like that. we are two generations in now, so we're at tensor G2 in the pixel and they have relatively weak raw performance and they also don't have great battery life and they're not very efficient. so I get why people say tensor sucks, but I don't think they should have stuck with Snapdragon. I still think there's time. I still think in two or three generations even, they could get to the point where they have such good optimization and such good calibration with exactly what they want to do with these chips, that they'll be the most efficient, best battery life, best experience- something that they could never have created by just buying an off-the-shelf bunch of Snapdragon ships. so I think today, like if today they literally offered a Snapdragon Google pixel with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and a tensor G2, I think today I would pick the Snapdragon one, but I don't think they should just give up on the tensor dream. okay, take all right, beats R and have always been very good. often people pretend that sound isn't incredibly subjective. a natural audiophilic sound is always less enjoyable and more jarring outside of pro referencing. you know, you bring up a really good point. audio is subjective. audio is definitely subjective. now, back in the days of uh making fun of Beats headphones for being overpriced, garbage sounding plastic, there was always uh, a little, a little kernel of Truth Underneath It All, which is that people still bought beats all the time and enjoyed them. and I always found that fascinating that you could literally tell people that there there's another pair of headphones out there that sounds better for half the money. and people in that world where it seems like a totally straightforward choice, they would still pick the beats and love them and recommend them. and the truth is like, yeah, for most people, if you just give them, like their, their first pair of nice headphones, their first pair of expensive headphones, and they've got this nice v-shaped equalizer, a big thumping bass, and they're not really thinking too hard about it being nice and flat and a nice professional sound, they're going to be impressed. it's going to sound really exciting and interesting for most music listening, which is what people are doing with Beats headphones. it's great, it's fine, like audio is. it really is one of the most subjective things in all of the tech world and there are tons of reviews and studies out there with countless examples of this. it kind of feels like the only trait in audio that people universally find impressive is just loudness, just higher volume, but kind of across the board anyone can kind of enjoy any sound signature and generally headphones these days are good enough to have an EQ and be able to sound differently based on different types of music and movies and whatever you're doing now. all that being said, I don't think I could still say that beats have always been very good. I they've. at some point in the past they were definitely a much more expensive, cheaply built version of the average headphones you could kind of just get anywhere else, but the marketing team has always been very good. that has always been good. so I think, yeah, decent headphones today- decent. take also side note. I continue to be so fascinated by the behavior of them as a company like beats, since they've been purchased by Apple, and the newest pair of Beats by Dre Studio Pro headphones are the latest example of that. let me know if you guys are interested in a video about these things by hitting that like button. either way, this has been really fun. I think we should do this again sometime, for sure, not doing that one. uh, so leave your hot takes. I say leave them in the comments section below and I'll sort of comb through those- it's not even mathematically correct- and I'll come through those and I'll find the best ones and we'll do another tech hot takes video in the future. have you read my shirt, this entire video, and I think that'll be really fun. just make sure they're a little more varied and different from this past one. I hate this. I hate this one."}, {"title": "iOS 17 Hands-On: Top 5 Features!", "description": "iOS 17, coming soon to an iPhone near you\n\nWhen Apple is a shark: https://youtu.be/qNAo0UdYF6g\n\nMKBHD Merch:

iPhone near you it seems like\nusually these updates get smaller and\nsmaller and less and less crazy but it\nfeels like this year for whatever reason\nApple has packed a ton of stuff into iOS\n17. this is going to be launching in\nSeptember when the new iPhone comes out\non everybody's iPhone but it's in beta\nnow and I've been using it and there's a\nlot of stuff here I'm going to try to\npack it into a top five but it was kind\nof hard I've been using this iOS 17 beta\nfor a few weeks now the public beta is\nout so if you want to try it before the\nnew iPhone even comes out you can do\nthat but let's take a look at the five\nmost impressive new things that are\ncoming to the iPhone but as we go\nthrough this I do want you to keep\nsomething in the back of your head just\njust keep this in mind a lot of times in\nthe past those features that we'd get\nwere really really big because they were\nnew capabilities\nmost if not all of these features depend\non having another iPhone in the mix\nwhether your friend has an iPhone or\nyour family has an iPhone you need two\niPhones for a lot of this stuff to work\njust something to keep in the back of\nyour head all right so number five\nairdrop airdrop is one of those things\nit's one of those features that when it\nworks it feels like it's one of the best\nthings ever but sometimes it's glitchy\nand it doesn't work and it seems\nterrible so I hope some stability\nimprovements are also in the works here\nbut basically apple is expanding airdrop\nto be more capable and easier to use the\nbig one is that if you meet another\nperson who also has an iPhone you can\nwalk up to them and bump your phones\ntogether you literally hold your phones\nup next to each other at a an inch or\ntwo apart and it'll play this sweet\nanimation as the phones talk to each\nother and transfer a contact poster with\nyour name and contact info to that other\nperson in a single touch it's called\nname drops pretty cool couple things\nabout this one is it lets you actually\nchoose which info you want to share so\nyou you do that phone bump thing and it\ngoes oh you want to share something do\nyou want to share just your phone number\nokay cool do you want to share your\nemail address and not your phone number\nyou can switch it over to that I want to\nshare a fake number sure program that in\ntwo this will all come from the my card\nat the top of contact settings that you\ncan customize with whatever photo you\nwant whatever fonts you want Etc and\neverything you change will show up to\npeople that have you in their contacts\nwhat's cooler though is you can actually\nNow bump to share photos or videos or\ncontent links or even start a share play\nsession basically it's making it easier\nto find a certain iPhone on AirPlay by\ngetting it roughly within NFC distance\nof another iPhone and then you can share\nstuff and then another cool thing\ntypically airdrop is a Wi-Fi Direct\nconnection between two iPhones but if\nyou leave each other if you you walk\naway down the street and you want to\ncontinue this file transfer that hasn't\nfinished yet it will resume over\ncellular so it'll start uploading to\nCellular and their phone will download\nand you can just walk away and airdrop\nshould finish I don't know if you\nremember an app from a while back called\nbump\nthis was in like 2009 it was literally\njust an app to bump phones together to\nshare contact information Google ended\nup buying them but I do have a feeling\nthat if they still existed now this\nwould be a sort of a Sherlock situation\njust another example of the remora fish\nto Apple's shark if that reference\ndoesn't make any sense I'll leave a\nvideo link below to the video that I did\ncomparing Apple to sharks it's a it\nmakes sense when you watch the video I\npromise so anyway number four is a\nfeature called personal voice so this\none's an accessibility setting it's not\neven something that they talked about on\nstage this is something that is not\nmeant for most people to use but it's\npretty cool anyway so in settings then\naccessibility you scroll down to the\nspeech section that's new here and\nthere's something called personal voice\nand you'll see a button that says create\na personal voice basically what's going\nto happen is your phone's gonna ask you\nto take it to a quiet place and then\nit's going to display a number of\nphrases on the screen and it'll ask you\nto say those phrases into the microphone\nit's 100 150 phrases they're pretty\nrandom they'll be like Sally sold\nseashells in 1979 and the president of\nMorocco is very tall and you just go\nthrough the list and you say a bunch of\nthese phrases and when it's done it\ncompiles all of your voice and will\nstitch together a new synthesized voice\nthat can say whatever you want to make\nit say it does all of this locally on\ndevice so it has no servers involved it\ndoesn't send your voice recordings\neverywhere it does all the compilation\novernight and at the end of this you\nbasically get a new voice on your phone\nyou can go to accessibility settings and\nthen enable live speech so that on the\ntriple tap of a power button it brings\nup a text block and you can type\nwhatever you whatever you want to make\nthe voice say and then just hit send hey\nquick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\nall right let's try another one here\na little more substance 30 frames per\nsecond is the correct frame rate and\nanyone who says otherwise is probably\nlying to you\nit kind of sounds like me and it's\ndecently good I wouldn't I wouldn't pass\nit off as human if I like played this\nrecording to you you wouldn't think it's\na person but it kind of sounds like I'm\ntalking on the phone to someone and it\nkind of has a poor connection you know\nbut this isn't some mainstream feature\nlike I said it's an accessibility\nsetting so a reason this is designed for\npeople who may know that they are at\nrisk of losing their voice at some point\nor maybe their vocal cords fatigue after\na long time there are conditions like\nthat MTD is a common one and so they can\nsort of go through this process and\ncreate a voice on their phone so that\nthey can continue to interact with the\nworld without using some generic Siri\nvoice and it actually kind of still\nsounds like them all right let's move on\nto the next bullet point number three\nthe little things the little things\nApple Apple's always tweaking and adding\nlittle features here and there to their\nstock apps especially there's a bunch of\nthose this time around and in total you\ncould say they add up to a welcome\nrefinement uh you probably heard about\nthe new keyboard which looks the same\nbut should be way Smarter with\nTransformer based autocorrect and\nimproved it's much faster dictation\nactually oh and also that thing where\nyou're typing a word and then you spell\nit a little bit different and then you\nhit space and it corrects you and then\nyou hit backspace and type it the way\nyou want again and hit space and it\ncorrects you again and it doesn't seem\nto learn\nthey fixed that also widgets are\nthankfully interactive now the whole\npoint of a widget I always thought was\nto be able to view and interact with\ninformation without jumping into the app\nwhich is trying to suck you in I'm\nsurprised it took this long but I am\nhappy to finally see that here there's\nalso now a bunch of new messages\nfeatures including one called check-in\nthis is good for I think either kids or\nmaybe significant others or friends you\nknow the dance you do where someone's\ngone somewhere and you're like all right\ntext me when you get there and then you\nwait for them to text you back or you\ncan share location or you just have them\ntext you when they arrive now there's\njust a feature built in you just hit the\nplus button you go to check in whoever\nis going to be checked in on can decide\nwho to share their location with how\nmuch data they want to share and then\nthere's this nice little tracker that\nupdates you and lets them know when\nthey've arrived where they're supposed\nto and there's a bunch of other little\nstuff like that sort of sprinkled around\nthe OS no doubt you've noticed still a\nlot of these depend on also having a\nfriend with an iPhone that's how most of\nthis works but you know if you do have\nthat ecosystem in your life then yeah\nthere's a bunch of good stuff that adds\nup to a good welcome Improvement good\nlittle stuff so all right number two is\ncalled standby mode so when I first saw\nthis feature I thought it was really\ninteresting but now I've thought about\nthis a lot the more I think about it I\nhave this so high on the list because I\nthink genuinely this is better than a\nhome pod for most people who already\nhave an iPhone basically it's a smart\nhome display so anytime your iPhone is\nboth charging and horizontal it triggers\nthe standby mode which is basically a\nclock and then whatever useful Widgets\nor photos you want to have in the\nbackground it really reminds me of the\nApple watch it kind of has a bunch of\nthese preset layouts and then you can\nliterally swipe between these three\nfaces to find the one you like and then\nswipe vertically to go through the\ndifferent styles so a lot of these yeah\nwill look just like an Apple Watch face\nbut yeah to be honest very useful so\nthat's already pretty convenient you can\nkind of just have it display information\nambiently to you whether it's on a\nnightstand or anger kitchen whatever but\nthen on top of that what makes it much\nmore home pod like is the fact that Siri\nis better in two ways first of all it's\nconversational so you don't have to keep\nhitting the button over and over again\nto keep asking it questions or\nfollow-ups you can just keep talking and\nit keeps listening which is great the\nother has been doing that forever and\nthen the other is you don't have to say\nhey\nher name you can just say Siri\nwhat's the weather in Manchester on\nSaturday\nhover around 67 degrees with overnight\nlows around 57.\nwhat about Sunday\nthank you\nand then it sort of stops listening but\nthe idea is it's just going to keep\nlistening and talking to you and that's\nbetter than before also that weather is\nnot great for golf but I don't know\nwe'll make it work either way big\nimprovements to Siri there that's what\nmakes it feel kind of like a you know a\nsmart home display now if only they\ncould make Siri actually good at other\nthings so then number one the top new\nfeature in iOS 17 I think we figured our\nphones are still phones sometimes but\nit's the phone app actually I'm\ncombining combining the phone app and\nFaceTime but generally there's a lot of\nnice features that sort of just make it\neasy to clean up and have a better phone\nexperience first of all are the contact\nposters like I mentioned earlier you set\nup your own contact poster and then\neveryone else who has you in their\ncontacts gets that updated in their\nphone at least if if they have an iPhone\nbut then yeah whenever you call someone\nthat's what they see and this sort of\nautomatically cleans up everyone's\ncontacts with a nice photo I know for\nfor one I basically have no photos for\nanyone in my contacts list outside of my\nfamily so this is a nice effortless\nImprovement for that and then another\nfun piece is if someone calls you and\nyou don't pick up and it starts going to\nvoicemail you will actually get a live\ntranscription of the voicemail as\nthey're leaving it and if you want to\ninterrupt and pick it up at any time you\nstill can some of you are too young to\nknow that that's actually a throwback to\nphysical answering machines that were in\npeople's houses where you could actually\nhear someone leaving you a voicemail and\nthen pick up the phone and interrupt it\nand actually talk to them just I'm old\nnow so I get to say stuff like that but\nalso FaceTime gets voicemail too which\nyou might be thinking wait it's FaceTime\nit's a video so what is a FaceTime\nvoicemail and it's literally just a\nvideo message so like if you're about to\nFaceTime someone and show them something\nbut then they don't pick up you'll just\nyou know record your video and then send\nthem the voicemail and then it shows up\ninside the FaceTime inbox which is cool\nbut there you go that is it that's that\nis the iOS 17 biggest stuff honestly I\nthink this is one of the biggest best\nupdates to iOS in a long time and\nsomehow there's still a bunch of little\nstuff I didn't even mention from camera\neffects to you know stickers all over\niMessage and stuff to Safari getting\nprofiles now there's a lot of stuff but\nagain now that we've gone through all of\nit don't forget about how many of these\nthings are intentionally just for people\nwith another iPhone in their life\nwhether it's a friend with an iPhone or\na family member with an iPhone or you\njust met someone with an iPhone from\nname drop to share play to all the\niMessage features the contact cards the\nFaceTime features that's the ecosystem\nat work that's them going hey this is a\ncool new feature but it'll only work if\nyour friend also has an iPhone so maybe\nyou pressure them into getting an iPhone\ntoo either way that's it feel free to\nshare this video with others who will\nprobably have this software update on\ntheir phone sometime soon and until the\nnext one\ncatch you guys later\npeace\n[Music]\n", "punctuated_text": "[Music] foreign. another year, another version of iOS come into an iPhone near you. it seems like usually these updates get smaller and smaller and less and less crazy, but it feels like this year, for whatever reason, Apple has packed a ton of stuff into iOS 17.. this is going to be launching in September when the new iPhone comes out on everybody's iPhone, but it's in beta now and I've been using it and there's a lot of stuff here. I'm going to try to pack it into a top five, but it was kind of hard. I've been using this iOS 17 beta for a few weeks now. the public beta is out. so if you want to try it before the new iPhone even comes out, you can do that. but let's take a look at the five most impressive new things that are coming to the iPhone. but as we go through this, I do want you to keep something in the back of your head. just just keep this in mind. a lot of times in the past, those features that we'd get were really really big because they were new capabilities. most, if not all, of these features depend on having another iPhone in the mix. whether your friend has an iPhone or your family has an iPhone, you need two iPhones for a lot of this stuff to work. just something to keep in the back of your head, all right. so number five, airdrop. airdrop is one of those things. it's one of those features that when it works it feels like it's one of the best things ever. but sometimes it's glitchy and it doesn't work and it seems terrible. so I hope some stability improvements are also in the works here. but basically, apple is expanding airdrop to be more capable and easier to use. the big one is that if you meet another person who also has an iPhone, you can walk up to them and bump your phones together. you literally hold your phones up next to each other at a, an inch or two apart, and it'll play this sweet animation as the phones talk to each other and transfer a contact poster with your name and contact info to that other person in a single touch. it's called name drops- pretty cool. couple things about this one is it lets you actually choose which info you want to share. so you, you do that phone bump thing and it goes: oh, you want to share something? do you want to share just your phone number? okay, cool. do you want to share your email address and not your phone number. you can switch it over to that. I want to share a fake number. sure, program that in two. this will all come from the my card at the top of contact settings that you can customize with whatever photo you want, whatever fonts you want, Etc. and everything you change will show up to people that have you in their contacts. what's cooler, though, is you can actually Now bump to share photos or videos or content links, or even start a share play session. basically, it's making it easier to find a certain iPhone on AirPlay by getting it roughly within NFC distance of another iPhone, and then you can share stuff. and then another cool thing: typically, airdrop is a Wi-Fi Direct connection between two iPhones, but if you leave each other, if you you walk away down the street and you want to continue this file transfer that hasn't finished yet, it will resume over cellular, so it'll start uploading to Cellular and their phone will download, and you can just walk away and airdrop should finish. I don't know if you remember an app from a while back called bump. this was in like 2009. it was literally just an app to bump phones together to share contact information. Google ended up buying them, but I do have a feeling that if they still existed now, this would be a sort of a Sherlock situation. just another example of the remora fish to Apple's shark. if that reference doesn't make any sense, I'll leave a video link below to the video that I did comparing Apple to sharks. it's a. it makes sense when you watch the video, I promise so anyway. number four is a feature called personal voice. so this one's an accessibility setting. it's not even something that they talked about on stage. this is something that is not meant for most people to use, but it's pretty cool anyway. so in settings, then accessibility, you scroll down to the speech section- that's new here- and there's something called personal voice and you'll see a button that says create a personal voice. basically, what's going to happen is your phone's gonna ask you to take it to a quiet place and then it's going to display a number of phrases on the screen and it'll ask you to say those phrases into the microphone. it's 100- 150 phrases. they're pretty random. they'll be like Sally sold seashells in 1979 and the president of Morocco is very tall, and you just go through the list and you say a bunch of these phrases and when it's done, it compiles all of your voice and will stitch together a new synthesized voice that can say whatever you want to make it say. it does all of this locally on device, so it has no servers involved. it doesn't send your voice recordings everywhere. it does all the compilation overnight and at the end of this you basically get a new voice on your phone. you can go to accessibility settings and then enable live speech so that on the triple tap of a power button it brings up a text block and you can type whatever you- whatever you want to make the voice say and then just hit send. hey, quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. all right, let's try another one here. a little more substance. 30 frames per second is the correct frame rate and anyone who says otherwise is probably lying to you. it kind of sounds like me and it's decently good. I wouldn't. I wouldn't pass it off as human. if I like. played this recording to you, you wouldn't think it's a person, but it kind of sounds like I'm talking on the phone to someone and it kind of has a poor connection. you know, but this isn't some mainstream feature. like I said, it's an accessibility setting. so a reason: this is designed for people who may know that they are at risk of losing their voice at some point, or maybe their vocal cords fatigue after a long time. there are conditions like that. MTD is a common one, and so they can sort of go through this process and create a voice on their phone so that they can continue to interact with the world without using some generic Siri voice, and it actually kind of still sounds like them. all right, let's move on to the next bullet point, number three: the little things. the little things, Apple. Apple's always tweaking and adding little features here and there to their stock apps especially. there's a bunch of those this time around and in total you could say they add up to a welcome refinement. uh, you probably heard about the new keyboard, which looks the same but should be way Smarter. with Transformer based, autocorrect and improved, it's much faster dictation actually. oh, and also that thing where you're typing a word and then you spell it a little bit different and then you hit space and it corrects you, and then you hit backspace and type it the way you want again and hit space and it corrects you again, and it doesn't seem to learn. they fixed that also. widgets are thankfully interactive now. the whole point of a widget I always thought was to be able to view and interact with information without jumping into the app which is trying to suck you in. I'm surprised it took this long, but I am happy to finally see that here. there's also now a bunch of new messages features, including one called check-in. this is good for, I think, either kids or maybe significant others or friends. you know the dance you do where someone's gone somewhere and you're like: all right, text me when you get there, and then you wait for them to text you back, or you can share location, or you just have them text you when they arrive. now there's just a feature built in: you just hit the plus button, you go to check in. whoever is going to be checked in on can decide who to share their location with how much data they want to share. and then there's this nice little tracker that updates you and lets them know when they've arrived where they're supposed to, and there's a bunch of other little stuff like that sort of sprinkled around the OS. no doubt you've noticed. still, a lot of these depend on also having a friend with an iPhone. that's how most of this works, but you know if you do have that ecosystem in your life, then, yeah, there's a bunch of good stuff that adds up to a good welcome Improvement. good little stuff, so all right. number two is called standby mode. so when I first saw this feature, I thought it was really interesting. but now I've thought about this a lot. the more I think about it. I have this so high on the list because I think genuinely this is better than a home pod for most people who already have an iPhone. basically, it's a smart home display. so anytime your iPhone is both charging and horizontal, it triggers the standby mode, which is basically a clock, and then whatever useful Widgets or photos you want to have in the background. it really reminds me of the Apple watch. it kind of has a bunch of these preset layouts and then you can literally swipe between these three faces to find the one you like and then swipe vertically to go through the different styles. so a lot of these, yeah, will look just like an Apple Watch face, but, yeah, to be honest, very useful. so that's already pretty convenient. you can kind of just have it display information ambiently to you, whether it's on a nightstand or anger kitchen whatever. but then, on top of that. what makes it much more home pod like is the fact that Siri is better in two ways. first of all, it's conversational, so you don't have to keep hitting the button over and over again to keep asking it questions or follow-ups, you can just keep talking and it keeps listening, which is great. the other has been doing that forever. and then the other is: you don't have to say hey, her name, you can just say Siri, what's the weather in Manchester on Saturday? hover around 67 degrees with overnight lows around 57. what about Sunday? thank you. and then it sort of stops listening. but the idea is it's just going to keep listening and talking to you and that's better than before. also, that weather is not great for golf, but I don't know. we'll make it work either way. big improvements to Siri there. that's what makes it feel kind of like a- you know, a smart home display now. if only they could make Siri actually good at other things. so then, number one, the top new feature in iOS 17, I think we figured our phones are still phones sometimes, but it's the phone app. actually I'm combining, combining the phone app and FaceTime, but generally there's a lot of nice features that sort of just make it easy to clean up and have a better phone experience. first of all are the contact posters. like I mentioned earlier, you set up your own contact poster and then everyone else who has you in their contacts gets that updated in their phone, at least if, if they have an iPhone. but then yeah, whenever you call someone, that's what they see. and this sort of automatically cleans up everyone's contacts with a nice photo. I know for for one, I basically have no photos for anyone in my contacts list outside of my family, so this is a nice effortless Improvement for that. and then another fun piece is: if someone calls you and you don't pick up and it starts going to voicemail, you will actually get a live transcription of the voicemail as they're leaving it. and if you want to interrupt and pick it up at any time, you still can. some of you are too young to know that that's actually a throwback to physical answering machines that were in people's houses where you could actually hear someone leaving you a voicemail and then pick up the phone and interrupt it and actually talk to them. just, I'm old now so I get to say stuff like that. but also FaceTime gets voicemail too, which you might be thinking: wait, it's FaceTime, it's a video. so what is a FaceTime voicemail? and it's literally just a video message. so like, if you're about to FaceTime someone and show them something, but then they don't pick up, you'll just, you know, record your video and then send them the voicemail and then it shows up inside the FaceTime inbox, which is cool. but there you go, that is it. that's. that is the iOS 17 biggest stuff. honestly, I think this is one of the biggest, best updates to iOS in a long time. and somehow there's still a bunch of little stuff I didn't even mention, from camera effects to, you know, stickers all over iMessage and stuff to Safari getting profiles. now there's a lot of stuff. but again, now that we've gone through all of it, don't forget about how many of these things are intentionally just for people with another iPhone in their life, whether it's a friend with an iPhone or a family member with an iPhone, or you just met someone with an iPhone, from name drop to share play to all the iMessage features, the contact cards, the FaceTime features. that's the ecosystem at work. that's them going. hey, this is a cool new feature, but it'll only work if your friend also has an iPhone, so maybe you pressure them into getting an iPhone too. either way, that's it, feel free to share this video with others who will probably have this software update on their phone sometime soon. and until the next one, catch you guys later. peace [Music]."}, {"title": "Nothing Phone 2 Review: A Real Personality!", "description": "The Nothing Phone 2 has a neat design, but it's

bit otherwise it looks pretty similar\nto the phone one but don't let that fool\nyou\n[Music]\nyou know humans are very visual\ncreatures and when the nothing phone 2\ndesign was revealed by this YouTuber I\nwas going through a lot of the comments\nand a lot of people were actually\ndisappointed that it looked so similar\nto the phone one like oh they barely\nthey barely changed anything but I think\nthat's actually missing the point like\ndon't get me wrong I understand that\npeople of course want an exciting new\ndesign but think about it if you're a\nbrand new company like a two-year-old\nsmartphone company and you're trying to\nestablish your your ID your DNA for the\nway your phones are gonna look you can't\ndramatically change things that much\nyear to year if your second phone looks\nwildly different from your first phone\nit's kind of hard to establish that you\nknow so yeah the glass is a little more\ncurved and the gray is lighter and\nthere's some adjustments to the LED\nzones and we'll get to that in a second\nbut generally it still looks like a\nnothing phone and that's on purpose but\nsecond of all the design\nit matters but it's not the only thing\nthat matters and actually a lot of the\nchanges with this phone are more than\nSkin Deep so using this phone for the\npast two weeks I do think overall it\nfeels more premium I'll say it doesn't\nnecessarily show in the specs but it's a\ncollection of things that have all been\nbumped up the display is now much\nbrighter up to 1600 nits so it's much\nmore visible Outdoors still 1080p 120\nhertz but it's ltpo this time around and\nthey move the selfie camera hole punch\nfrom the corner to the middle and the\nbezels are a little bit thinner all the\nway around making room for a slightly\nlarger display just a little bit more\nrefined I also still wish the optical\nfingerprint reader was a little higher\nup on the screen and a little bit faster\nbut honestly still par for the course as\nfar as phones in this price range along\nwith the ip54 water and dust resistance\noverall similar phone slightly better\nbut most of the changes with this guy\nare under the hood so let's go there\nfirst of all they picked the Snapdragon\n8 plus gen 1 essentially a last\ngeneration Flagship chip this means it's\nmuch better than the previous phone but\nnot quite up to date with some of the\nhighest end phones today rocking the\nSnapdragon 8 Gen 2 and then the base\nversion has 8 gigs of RAM but this\nversion I've been testing has 12 and\nit's been excellent very smooth all the\nway around I mean I've been leaving on\nthe dynamic refresh rate setting and it\nfeels like it's 120 hertz most of the\ntime it's very responsive it's great it\ndid occasionally hang sometimes and I've\nhad some weird one-off bugs that are\nhard to replicate including more thermal\nwarnings that I'm used to seeing in a\nphone especially while wireless charging\nbut overall it's been pretty solid and\nthat brings me right to the software\nexperience with this phone\nthis phone has a lot of character like\nthere are a lot of little like tweaks\nand UI things and features stuff that\nthey've added that made me go oh\nlike that's really nice like I like the\nfact that you can choose how large an\nicon is on your home screen so if you\nwant to have a you got a nice little\ngrid array going on and you have an app\nyou open a lot you can make it double\nsized and just kind of tucks into your\ngrid like it's the size of I guess four\nicons they redesigned how folders look\non the home screen I think it also looks\nreally good you can add any Quick\nSettings as a widget on your home screen\nwhich is dope I don't know why I never\nthought of that and then even better is\nlock screen widgets so for this it's\nonly nothing's widgets but they have a\npretty good variety of them a lot of\nweather widgets clocks and things like\nthat and they literally stay visible all\nthe time with this nice little dot\nmatrix version on the always-on display\nso I love having the weather up here and\nthen the quick shortcut to the\nflashlight it would be cool if\nthird-party apps could plug into this\ntoo but for now it's already really neat\nthere's still the nothing dot fonts\neverywhere and the dot Motif with the\nbrightness slider and the volume slider\nthings like that and then of course on\ntop of all of that you've got all the\nglyph stuff some people are like this is\na total gimmick some people are like\nthis is the greatest thing ever I love\nit\nI feel like I'm somewhere in between so\nthese LEDs are actually a little bit\nbrighter and a little bit wider compared\nto the nothing fun one uh there's a\nslightly different design too so with\nthe pair of LEDs around the cameras\ninstead of one solid Arc and then the\nlarge C in the middle gets split up into\nsix different sections but then as I\nmentioned in that dope Tech unveiling\nvideo there are more addressable zones\nfor the LEDs on the back so meaning\ninstead of just lighting everything up\nat once there are quite a few more\nsoftware features now to take advantage\nof the more precise control stuff like\nthe countdown timer and the progress\nindicator for third-party apps starting\nwith Uber and zomato I got it right that\ntime in addition to the charging\nprogress indicator light at the bottom\nthere's also long pressing the torch for\nthe glyph flashlight which is kind of\nsweet it's actually it's not as bright\nbut it's much softer and there's also\nthe essential notification light so you\ncan assign that top right stripe to\nlight up and stay lit up anytime you get\na notification from one specific app\nChoice until you address that\nnotification\nand the glyph composer of course to\nbuild your own notification sound do I\nthink it's a little bit gimmicky yeah\nfor sure there's definitely some some\nweird novelty that you're probably not\ngoing to use but I think among all that\nstuff there's at least some pieces of it\nsomewhere that some people will find\nuseful I guess I just don't understand\nhow hard could it be to give people more\nfull customization control of the lights\nlike you can okay if I have one app that\nI really know I want to pay attention to\nthen that's the one stripe up here but\nwhat if I have three or four apps and I\njust want to make sure I assign them to\nthree or four different lights on the\nback like because that's an impossible\nengineering challenge or do they just\nnot want us to be able to do that for\nsome reason\nI don't know but you can't either way I\nwant to get back to what I said before\nwhich is that this phone has character\nfor real so this is all part of\nnothing's self-titled nothing os2 but to\nbe more specific it's basically\nnothing's skin on top of Android 13\nright now and I kind of feel the same\nway about it that I do about Google\npixel like the pixel has its own\ncharacter version of Android and this\nphone kinda also has its own character\nversion that's present throughout the\nexperience you know it's a London based\ncompany so it says things like airplane\nmode and color correction and the trash\nin Google photos is called the bin it\nhas the monotone desktop icons by\ndefault which always start off so\npromising and every time someone tries\nto do it I want it to work so bad but\nthen there's always just a few apps that\nare not supported and ruin the look this\nis also true here but I really respect\nthe clear back thing I've been pretty\npumped about some other transparent\ngadgets lately and somebody pointed out\nthe uneven glue in the hinge of the\nBeats Studio buds plus case and I\nhaven't been able to unsee it since but\nreally that made me appreciate more that\nnothing is doing a ton of transparent\nthemed stuff and even added a\ntransparent cable this year well the\nends of the cable not the actual cable\nbut still kind of cool and you don't see\nother companies doing the clean neat\ntransparent stuff this well so then I\nguess let's just get to the meat of this\nto the most important things with any\nnew phone are going to be battery life\nand cameras\nand battery life on this new phone is\nmuch improved\nthe cameras\nnot so much so the battery situation\nactually is awesome it went up from a\n4500 to 4700 milliamp hour battery it\nalso went to a more power efficient\nnewer chip and it's bumped up to 45 watt\nPeak charging so even with the higher\nfresh rate on a higher screen brightness\nand all sorts of new apps like threads\ncoming out where I'm spending like hours\nof screen on time per day follow me over\nthere I guess uh turns out this thing\ncan keep it going for six seven hours of\nscreen on time no problem and when you\ndo plug into a fast charger which is not\nincluded in the box but when you do it's\npretty quick it can go from zero to full\nin an hour and there's even 15 watt\nwireless charging like I mentioned\nearlier it's the completely worry-free\nbattery package even if it does overheat\na few times on that wireless car charger\nso then the camera's back here on the\nother hand we're a little bit more of a\nbummer a bit inconsistent for me so\nstill dual camera is still a primary\ncamera and an ultra wide no telephoto\nand they've upgraded sensors now so 50\nmegapixels each but it's not it's not\nthe no number of pixels that matters\nit's the quality of them so I think it's\nmore helpful context to know this is the\nSony IMX 890 for the primary sensor\nwhich is the same one that's in the\nOnePlus 11 and the OnePlus nord3 this is\na very average camera system in perfect\nlighting like the aperture is wide\nenough and the sensor is big enough that\nyou get some good looking photos with\nshallow depth of field and when the\nsubject is up close they look good\ncolors are solid and processing isn't\ntoo dramatic so when you take landscape\nshots too things look sharp across the\nboard but two things I've noticed one is\nin lower light it starts to fall apart\nmore you either get more noisy or more\nsoft photos pretty quickly not a shocker\nwe've seen this before and in the\npremium mid-range space that feels kind\nof like again par for the course right\nbelow the impressive pixel 7s and the\nnot so impressive OnePlus Norris of the\nworld but the other thing is it has this\nweird bug that I've seen just a few\ntimes where a moving subject has this\nweird ghosting which is not good it I'm\nguessing it's a weird laggy HDR\nprocessing where it's trying to combine\nframes and it has some sort of a weird\nlag while capturing those frames either\nway I haven't seen this bug in any other\nphone camera in years hopefully it's\njust that a bug that they can fix and\nalong with those other quirks and weird\nthings I've talked about they can iron\nthat stuff out before shipping this\nphone to the world and also one other\nquick random thing that didn't quite fit\nin the rest of this review the haptics\nfor the keyboard are very strong which\nis fine but I can't adjust them and\nthey're so strong you can actually hear\nthem if you can\nit's not the sound of my hand hitting\nthe phone that's like the sound of the\nvibration motor being too strong I just\nwant to be able to adjust that I can't\nfind it in the settings please nothing\nlet me adjust the haptic strength of the\nkeyboard but anyway the last big pillar\nclearly is the new price so\nthe previous nothing phone started\nfirmly in I would say mid-range\nterritory it was 399 Euro\nand this phone starts at 599 U.S so it's\nbumped up and that's actually for the\nstarting one so that's eight gigs of RAM\nand 128 gigs of storage that I just\nturned the torch on of course I did\num but I think once you bump up to the\n12 256 you quickly get into 700 phone\nterritory so\nis that actually worth it it's a much\nmore expensive phone and I think the\nanswer is if you think worth it is\npurely a Specs question then you\nprobably won't see this phone as worth\nit it doesn't have the most amazing\nspecs in the world uh matter of fact I\ncan kind of already see the two sides of\nhow people will Embrace this phone like\nyou'll have the our Android community on\nReddit saying okay this is basically\njust an average mid-range phone nothing\ntoo special quirky design whatever and\nthen you'll see you'll have like the the\nnothing investor Club being like this is\nthis is the greatest design ever in a\nphone it's the coolest thing ever made\nthe truth\nper usual Falls somewhere in between\nmatter of fact I think the funny thing\nis both those groups probably have in\ncommon that they probably haven't used\nthe phone yet and I think once you do\nand you actually get used to it you\nrealize that the specs and the design\nare both not the primary thing about\nthis phone when we actually use it it's\nreally the software it's absolutely\ndefined by this character filled\nsoftware and that part even if it's a\nlittle buggy\nis really fun it's really solid\nso that's what makes it the nothing\nphone too\nthanks for watching\ncatch you guys the next one peace\nforeign\n", "punctuated_text": "this is a nothing phone 2.. you can tell because the glass on the back is rounded a bit. otherwise it looks pretty similar to the phone one. but don't let that fool you. [Music]. you know, humans are very visual creatures and when the nothing phone 2 design was revealed by this YouTuber, I was going through a lot of the comments and a lot of people were actually disappointed that it looked so similar to the phone one. like, oh they barely, they barely changed anything. but I think that's actually missing the point. like don't get me wrong, I understand that people of course want an exciting new design. but think about it. if you're a brand new company, like a two-year-old smartphone company, and you're trying to establish your, your ID, your DNA for the way your phones are gonna look, you can't dramatically change things that much year to year. if your second phone looks wildly different from your first phone, it's kind of hard to establish that, you know. so yeah, the glass is a little more curved and the gray is lighter and there's some adjustments to the LED zones and we'll get to that in a second. but generally it still looks like a nothing phone and that's on purpose. but second of all, the design: it matters, but it's not the only thing that matters and actually a lot of the changes with this phone are more than Skin Deep. so, using this phone for the past two weeks, I do think overall it feels more premium. I'll say it doesn't necessarily show in the specs, but it's a collection of things that have all been bumped up. the display is now much brighter- up to 1600 nits- so it's much more visible Outdoors. still 1080p, 120 hertz, but it's ltpo this time around, and they move the selfie camera hole punch from the corner to the middle and the bezels are a little bit thinner all the way around, making room for a slightly larger display, just a little bit more refined. I also still wish the optical fingerprint reader was a little higher up on the screen and a little bit faster, but honestly still par for the course as far as phones in this price range, along with the ip54, water and dust resistance. overall similar phone, slightly better, but most of the changes with this guy are under the hood, so let's go there. first of all, they picked the Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1, essentially a last generation Flagship chip. this means it's much better than the previous phone, but not quite up to date with some of the highest end phones today, rocking the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and then the base version has 8 gigs of RAM, but this version I've been testing has 12 and it's been excellent, very smooth all the way around. I mean I've been leaving on the dynamic refresh rate setting and it feels like it's 120 hertz most of the time. it's very responsive. it's great. it did occasionally hang sometimes and I've had some weird one-off bugs that are hard to replicate, including more thermal warnings that I'm used to seeing in a phone, especially while wireless charging. but overall it's been pretty solid. and that brings me right to the software experience with this phone. this phone has a lot of character. like there are a lot of little like tweaks and UI things and features, stuff that they've added. that made me go, oh, like that's really nice. like I like the fact that you can choose how large an icon is on your home screen. so if you want to have a, you got a nice little grid array going on and you have an app, you open a lot, you can make it double sized and just kind of tucks into your grid. like it's the size of, I guess, four icons. they redesigned how folders look on the home screen. I think it also looks really good. you can add any Quick Settings as a widget on your home screen, which is dope, I don't know why I never thought of that. and then even better is lock screen widgets. so for this it's only nothing's widgets, but they have a pretty good variety of them: a lot of weather widgets, clocks and things like that, and they literally stay visible all the time with this nice little dot matrix version on the always-on display. so I love having the weather up here and then the quick shortcut to the flashlight. it would be cool if third-party apps could plug into this too, but for now it's already really neat. there's still the nothing dot fonts everywhere and the dot Motif with the brightness slider and the volume slider, things like that. and then, of course, on top of all of that you've got all the glyph stuff. some people are like this is a total gimmick. some people are like this is the greatest thing ever. I love it. I feel like I'm somewhere in between. so these LEDs are actually a little bit brighter and a little bit wider compared to the nothing fun one. uh, there's a slightly different design too, so with the pair of LEDs around the cameras instead of one solid Arc, and then the large C in the middle gets split up into six different sections. but then, as I mentioned in that dope Tech unveiling video, there are more addressable zones for the LEDs on the back. so meaning, instead of just lighting everything up at once, there are quite a few more software features now to take advantage of the more precise control stuff, like the countdown timer and the progress indicator for third-party apps, starting with Uber and zomato. I got it right that time. in addition to the charging progress indicator light at the bottom, there's also long pressing the torch for the glyph flashlight, which is kind of sweet- it's actually. it's not as bright but it's much softer. and there's also the essential notification light, so you can assign that top right stripe to light up and stay lit up anytime you get a notification from one specific app Choice until you address that notification, and the glyph composer, of course, to build your own notification sound do. I think it's a little bit gimmicky? yeah, for sure, there's definitely some, some weird novelty that you're probably not going to use, but I think among all that stuff there's at least some pieces of it somewhere that some people will find useful. I guess I just don't understand how hard could it be to give people more full customization control of the lights, like you can? okay, if I have one app that I really know I want to pay attention to, then that's the one stripe up here. but what if I have three or four apps and I just want to make sure I assign them to three or four different lights on the back, like because that's an impossible engineering challenge, or do they just not want us to be able to do that for some reason? I don't know, but you can't either way. I want to get back to what I said before, which is that this phone has character for real. so this is all part of nothing's self-titled nothing os2. but, to be more specific, it's basically nothing's skin on top of Android 13 right now, and I kind of feel the same way about it that I do about Google pixel. like the pixel has its own character version of Android, and this phone kinda also has its own character version that's present throughout the experience. you know it's a London based company, so it says things like airplane mode and color correction, and the trash in Google photos is called the bin. it has the monotone desktop icons by default which always start off so promising, and every time someone tries to do it I want it to work so bad, but then there's always just a few apps that are not supported and ruin the look. this is also true here, but I really respect the clear back thing. I've been pretty pumped about some other transparent gadgets lately, and somebody pointed out the uneven glue in the hinge of the Beats Studio buds plus case, and I haven't been able to unsee it since, but really that made me appreciate more that nothing is doing a ton of transparent themed stuff and even added a transparent cable this year. well, the ends of the cable, not the actual cable, but still kind of cool, and you don't see other companies doing the clean, neat, transparent stuff this well. so then I guess let's just get to the meat of this, to. the most important things with any new phone are going to be battery life and cameras, and battery life on this new phone is much improved. the cameras not so much. so the battery situation actually is awesome. it went up from a 4500 to 4700 milliamp hour battery. it also went to a more power, efficient, newer chip and it's bumped up to 45 watt Peak charging. so even with the higher fresh rate on a higher screen brightness and all sorts of new apps like threads coming out where I'm spending like hours of screen on time per day. follow me over there, I guess. uh, turns out this thing can keep it going for six, seven hours of screen on time, no problem. and when you do plug into a fast charger- which is not included in the box, but when you do, it's pretty quick. it can go from zero to full in an hour and there's even 15 watt wireless charging, like I mentioned earlier. it's the completely worry-free battery package, even if it does overheat a few times on that wireless car charger. so then the camera's back here. on the other hand, we're a little bit more of a bummer, a bit inconsistent for me. so still, dual camera is still a primary camera and an ultra wide, no telephoto. and they've upgraded sensors now so 50 megapixels each. but it's not, it's not the no number of pixels that matters, it's the quality of them. so I think it's more helpful context to know. this is the Sony IMX 890 for the primary sensor, which is the same one that's in the OnePlus 11 and the OnePlus nord3. this is a very average camera system in perfect lighting, like the aperture is wide enough and the sensor is big enough that you get some good looking photos with shallow depth of field, and when the subject is up close they look good, colors are solid and processing isn't too dramatic. so when you take landscape shots too, things look sharp across the board. but two things I've noticed. one is in lower light it starts to fall apart more. you either get more noisy or more soft photos pretty quickly. not a shocker, we've seen this before and in the premium mid-range space that feels kind of like again par for the course, right below the impressive pixel 7s and the not so impressive OnePlus Norris of the world. but the other thing is it has this weird bug that I've seen just a few times, where a moving subject has this weird ghosting which is not good it I'm guessing it's a weird laggy HDR processing where it's trying to combine frames and it has some sort of a weird lag while capturing those frames. either way, I haven't seen this bug in any other phone camera in years. hopefully it's just that, a bug that they can fix, and, along with those other quirks and weird things I've talked about, they can iron that stuff out before shipping this phone to the world and also one other quick, random thing that didn't quite fit in the rest of this review. the haptics for the keyboard are very strong, which is fine, but I can't adjust them and they're so strong you can actually hear them, if you can. it's not the sound of my hand hitting the phone, that's like the sound of the vibration motor being too strong. I just want to be able to adjust that. I can't find it in the settings. please, nothing. let me adjust the haptic strength of the keyboard. but anyway, the last big pillar clearly is the new price. so the previous nothing phone started firmly in, I would say, mid-range territory. it was 399 Euro and this phone starts at 599 US. so it's bumped up and that's actually for the starting one. so that's eight gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage that I just turned the torch on. of course I did um, but I think once you bump up to the 12 256, you quickly get into 700 phone territory. so is that actually worth it? it's a much more expensive phone and I think the answer is: if you think worth it is purely a Specs question, then you probably won't see this phone as worth it. it doesn't have the most amazing specs in the world. uh, matter of fact, I can kind of already see the two sides of how people will Embrace this phone. like you'll have the, our Android community on Reddit saying, okay, this is basically just an average mid-range phone, nothing too special, quirky design whatever. and then you'll see you'll have, like the, the nothing investor Club, being like: this is this is the greatest design ever in a phone, it's the coolest thing ever made. the truth, per usual, Falls somewhere in between. matter of fact, I think the funny thing is both those groups probably have in common that they probably haven't used the phone yet and I think once you do and you actually get used to it, you realize that the specs and the design are both not the primary thing about this phone. when we actually use it, it's really the software. it's absolutely defined by this character filled software, and that part, even if it's a little buggy, is really fun, it's really solid. so that's what makes it the nothing phone too.

about how well it sells but I'd\nactually want to use it\nI think this is what I would make\n[Music]\nokay so y'all remember the Zenfone 9\nfrom last year right it won my best\nsmall phone of the Year award easily and\nalmost won my MVP for the whole year\nwith so much going for it the smallest\nsize the latest chip outstanding battery\nlife a plus performance Rock Solid\ncameras and fluid and clean software and\na headphone jack I mean all of it was\nwrapped up in a 700 package in the US I\nmean they just do not make phones like\nthis anymore so now we've got the\nZenfone 10 here and I think this one is\nnearly perfect first of all they kept\nbasically all the great stuff actually\nyeah all of the great stuff from the\nlast phone all the fundamentals that\nmade it so good it's the latest chip\nagain it's the Snapdragon 8 gen 2. it's\nstill awesome performance still\nworld-class battery life yes it still\nhas a headphone jack but they've also\ndirectly improved upon the three minor\nnitpicks that I actually did have with\nlast year's phone the first nitpick was\nthat phone didn't have wireless charging\na lot of people said oh this would have\nbeen a great phone but it doesn't have\nwireless charging now we've got it that\nwas basically the only missing spec\nZenfone 10 now has the same size battery\nand I'm happy to report that the\nSnapdragon 8 Gen 2 and software combo is\nstill giving world-class battery life\nI'm literally getting seven eight plus\nhours of screen on time every single day\nand I basically never kill it in under\n24 hours so now it's wired charging at\n30 Watts with the charger included in\nthe box and now 15 watt wireless\ncharging so there's basically no\nweakness here happy to see it the second\nnitpick I had was actually the finish on\nthe back so I still have my original\nZenfone 9 here same color but I don't\nknow if you remember I use this for\nabout a month during my review period\nand it got absolutely chewed up it's\ndarker all the way around the outside\naround the corners mostly from wearing\nblack pants you know the material wore\noff and stained the soft touch of the\nback of the Zenfone 9 was very easily\nworn down very quickly and I understand\nmost people just immediately put a case\non their new phone so I'm not can ignore\nthat but I also think if you're going to\nmake a phone with like a nice soft touch\nfinish you want to be able to touch it\nyou should it would be nice if you could\nuse it like normal and not have this\ninsanely accelerated aging so Asus told\nme there's a slightly different material\non the back of this Zenfone 10. it feels\na little bit a little bit more coarse if\nanything but it's still got this soft\ntouch finish it's still got this\nslightly gritty texture and from the\nlooks of it so far it's more durable and\nyou can also see there's a new Asus logo\ndown here in the corner and some\nslightly cleaned up text on the back of\nthe phone but I still think it looks\nnice and there's a bunch of color\noptions now I've been showing you the\neclipse red which is the one I've been\nusing but there's also a blue there's a\ngreen a black and a comet white that's\nthe only one I'm nervous about that\nmight not hold up as well but still if\nI'm judging just by the way this red has\ngone it's more durable than last year\nwhich is awesome it still rolls over\ninto those flat matte black metal sides\nand a little cutouts for the headphone\njack and the power buttons fingerprint\nreader this is really nicely built\nassuming it continues to hold up the way\nit has this is also fixed so then the\nlast little nitpick was that these\naren't Flagship cameras\ntruly a nitpick because this isn't a\nflagship price phone and honestly these\nare very good cameras Asus has done a\ngreat job with their software tuning for\nyears and their cameras now but they\nhave updated the cameras in the Zenfone\n10. it's still a 50 megapixel primary\ncamera with a great contrasty software\nprocessing and a lot of dynamic range\nbut now there's an even more improved\nhybrid gimbal stabilization system it's\npart of the reason why the rings on the\nback of this phone are so big there's a\nhuge six axis stabilization system\ntaking the handshake out of still shots\nand also delivering some of the most\nimpressive Shake resistant video I have\never seen so even without making the\nsensor bigger or higher resolution you\nend up with sharper handheld exposures\nand sharper low light shots because the\nwhole camera system is better at\ncanceling out hand movement and also\nsince there is no telephoto camera they\ndid work on software Zoom improvements\nthe difference isn't really dramatic and\nit's still not as good as having a\ndedicated Zoom but it's better than\nnothing once you get past about four or\nfive x all that packaged up into a\nslightly more subtle looking pair of\nblack rings on the back of this phone\nI'd consider that another win if I could\nstill nitpick about cameras I would\nactually nitpick a little bit about the\nfront facing camera it's still got this\nlittle silver ring in the corner kind of\nreminds me of the Samsung a54 and it\njust makes it stick out a little bit\ninstead of being a seamless cut out like\nsome other phones it's not a disaster\nbut it's there so it's not perfect\nthere's also technically some other\nlittle stuff that they did as well uh\nyou might have seen it's 144hz display\nnow they can say that on the spec sheet\nbut it's only 144 Hertz while gaming in\ncertain games but really it still spends\nmost of its time at 120 hertz and it's\nsuper smooth and it's ltpo which is\ngreat but as you can see they're\ntechnically allowed to say it's 144\nHertz capable now and they also added a\nlittle extra capability for the smart\nkey on the side the power button can now\ndo quintuple Duty it's a power button\nit's a fingerprint reader you can double\ntap to open the camera you can long\npress for whatever you want I do Google\nassistant and you can swipe up and down\nfor that notification slider and just in\ngeneral Asus software is still still so\ngood it's clean it's nearly stock\nAndroid and they just got you know a few\nextra optimizations and extra features\nin there that they've added that are\ngenerally very useful things like\nbattery health features and the the\nlittle Edge tool shortcut they've got\ngoing on I wish you could open apps this\nis another little nitpick I wish you\ncould open apps full screen from The\nEdge tool but that only lets you open\napps windowed on an already small phone\nbut maybe the most unique thing I've\nseen that really feels like something\nlike I would do if I was making an\nEnthusiast film that most people\nwouldn't care about but still really\ncool is the ability to customize the\nsoftware experience way more\nspecifically so when you first unbox and\nset up the phone you can actually go\nthrough the menus and choose which parts\nof the phone you want to be like stock\nAndroid and which parts you want to be\nAsus customized from things like the\nlauncher to the Quick Settings I've\nnever seen this in any any other phone\nsetup only Asus does it I love it and\nthey wrap up all these improvements and\nlittle nitpick fixes in a phone that is\nthe same price as last year again who\ndoes that uh the price was kind of\nconfusing I think a little bit to some\npeople but basically it's still the same\nprice as last year 6.99 in the US but\nthen the Europe pricing includes taxes\nand import fees so it ended up at 7.99\nEuro\neither way literally still a great deal\nso my final nitpick my really my last\nthing that I would like to see improved\nwith these Zen phones that would really\nput it over the edge and nearly a\nperfect phone is software support So\nAsus right now promises basically two\nyears of software updates for the\nZenfone which is okay but it's this is\nnot the full life cycle of a phone like\nthis you'd ideally have it for three or\nfour years and having it fully supported\nfor those three to four years would be\nreally nice but other than that\nwell done Asus clearly there is no\nperfect phone but this one is pretty\nclose\nthanks for watching\ncatch you guys in the next one peace\n", "punctuated_text": "all right, this is the Asus Zenfone 10.. honestly, if you task me with making my own phone- and I didn't have to care at all about how well it sells, but I'd actually want to use it- I think this is what I would make. [Music]. okay, so y'all remember the Zenfone 9 from last year. right, it won my best small phone of the Year award easily and almost won my MVP for the whole year, with so much going for it: the smallest size, the latest chip, outstanding battery life, a plus performance, Rock Solid cameras and fluid and clean software and a headphone jack. I mean, all of it was wrapped up in a 700 package in the US, I mean, they just do not make phones like this anymore. so now we've got the Zenfone 10 here and I think this one is nearly perfect. first of all, they kept basically all the great stuff- actually, yeah, all of the great stuff- from the last phone, all the fundamentals that made it so good. it's the latest chip again. it's the Snapdragon 8 gen 2.. it's still awesome performance, still world-class battery life. yes, it still has a headphone jack, but they've also directly improved upon the three minor nitpicks that I actually did have with last year's phone. the first nitpick was that phone didn't have wireless charging. a lot of people said, oh, this would have been a great phone but it doesn't have wireless charging. now we've got it. that was basically the only missing spec. Zenfone 10 now has the same size battery and I'm happy to report that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and software combo is still giving world-class battery life. I'm literally getting seven, eight plus hours of screen on time every single day and I basically never kill it in under 24 hours. so now it's wired charging at 30 Watts with the charger included in the box and now 15 watt wireless charging. so there's basically no weakness here. happy to see it. the second nitpick I had was actually the finish on the back. so I still have my original Zenfone 9 here, same color, but I don't know if you remember, I use this for about a month during my review period and it got absolutely chewed up. it's darker all the way around the outside, around the corners, mostly from wearing black pants, you know. the material wore off and stained. the soft touch of the back of the Zenfone 9 was very easily worn down very quickly and I understand most people just immediately put a case on their new phone. so I'm not can ignore that. but I also think if you're going to make a phone with like a nice soft touch finish, you want to be able to touch it. you should. it would be nice if you could use it like normal and not have this insanely accelerated aging. so Asus told me there's a slightly different material on the back of this Zenfone 10.. it feels a little bit- a little bit more coarse, if anything, but it's still got this soft touch finish. it's still got this slightly gritty texture and, from the looks of it so far it's more durable. and you can also see there's a new Asus logo down here in the corner and some slightly cleaned up text on the back of the phone. but I still think it looks nice. and there's a bunch of color options. now I've been showing you the eclipse red, which is the one I've been using, but there's also a blue, there's a green, a black and a comet white. that's the only one I'm nervous about. that might not hold up as well, but still, if I'm judging just by the way this red has gone, it's more durable than last year, which is awesome. it still rolls over into those flat, matte black metal sides and a little cutouts for the headphone jack and the power buttons fingerprint reader. this is really nicely built, assuming it continues to hold up the way it has. this is also fixed. so then, the last little nitpick was that these aren't Flagship cameras- truly a nitpick, because this isn't a flagship price phone and, honestly, these are very good cameras. Asus has done a great job with their software tuning for years and their cameras now, but they have updated the cameras in the Zenfone 10.. it's still a 50 megapixel primary camera with a great contrasty software processing and a lot of dynamic range, but now there's an even more improved hybrid gimbal stabilization system. it's part of the reason why the rings on the back of this phone are so big. there's a huge six axis stabilization system taking the handshake out of still shots and also delivering some of the most impressive Shake resistant video I have ever seen. so even without making the sensor bigger or higher resolution, you end up with sharper handheld exposures and sharper low light shots, because the whole camera system is better at canceling out hand movement and also since there is no telephoto camera, they did work on software Zoom improvements. the difference isn't really dramatic and it's still not as good as having a dedicated Zoom, but it's better than nothing. once you get past about four or five x, all that packaged up into a slightly more subtle looking pair of black rings on the back of this phone, I'd consider that another win. if I could still nitpick about cameras, I would actually nitpick a little bit about the front facing camera. it's still got this little silver ring in the corner. kind of reminds me of the Samsung a54 and it just makes it stick out a little bit instead of being a seamless cut out like some other phones. it's not a disaster, but it's there, so it's not perfect. there's also technically some other little stuff that they did as well. uh, you might have seen it's 144hz display now. they can say that on the spec sheet, but it's only 144 Hertz while gaming in certain games, but really it still spends most of its time at 120 hertz and it's super smooth and it's ltpo, which is great, but as you can see, they're technically allowed to say it's 144 Hertz capable now. and they also added a little extra capability for the smart key on the side. the power button can now do quintuple Duty. it's a power button, it's a fingerprint reader. you can double tap to open the camera. you can long press for whatever you want. I do Google assistant and you can swipe up and down for that notification slider and just in general, Asus software is still still so good, it's clean, it's nearly stock Android and they just got, you know, a few extra optimizations and extra features in there that they've added that are generally very useful things, like battery health features and the the little Edge tool shortcut they've got going on. I wish you could open apps. this is another little nitpick. I wish you could open apps full screen from The Edge tool, but that only lets you open apps windowed on an already small phone. but maybe the most unique thing I've seen that really feels like something like I would do if I was making an Enthusiast film that most people wouldn't care about but still really cool, is the ability to customize the software experience way more specifically. so when you first unbox and set up the phone, you can actually go through the menus and choose which parts of the phone you want to be like stock Android and which parts you want to be Asus customized, from things like the launcher to the Quick Settings. I've never seen this in any any other phone setup. only Asus does it. I love it and they wrap up all these improvements and little nitpick fixes in a phone that is the same price as last year. again, who does that? uh, the price was kind of confusing, I think a little bit to some people, but basically it's still the same price as last year: 6.99 in the US, but then the Europe pricing includes taxes and import fees, so it ended up at 7.99 Euro either way- literally still a great deal. so my final nitpick my really my last thing that I would like to see improved with these Zen phones- that would really put it over the edge, and nearly a perfect phone- is software support. So Asus right now promises basically two years of software updates for the Zenfone, which is okay, but it's. this is not the full life cycle of a phone like this. you'd ideally have it for three or four years and having it fully supported for those three to four years would be really nice. but other than that, well done Asus. clearly there is no perfect phone, but this one is pretty close. thanks for watching. catch you guys in the next one. peace."}, {"title": "Dope Tech: Nothing Phone 2 Redesign!", "description": "Cleo's video: https://youtu.be/u7pu1cQBqtQ\n\nThanks Eight Sleep for sponsoring DopeTech!

welcome\nback to dope Tech this we already know\nTech and production value is already\nsome of the most fun stuff we do here\nand I remember one of my favorite\nepisodes of this we ever did was playing\nwith the cinema robots in Portland and\nby the end thinking\nit's crazy but I think we might have to\nget one of these things\nand I have a sneaky feeling that might\nbe happening again on this shoot because\nwell this isn't my normal Studio as you\nmay have thought\ncould get interesting\nall right welcome back to another\nepisode of dope Tech I've got three\nreally interesting things I want to show\nyou guys for this one the first one as\nyou can probably already tell is a piece\nof video production Tech I get\nunnecessarily excited about the bleeding\nedge of production video stuff but this\nthis is a whole different kind of\nproduction this would be what's referred\nto as virtual production so let's rewind\nfor a second I want to oversimplify but\nI think there's basically three\ndifferent types of three different\nlevels of production level one being\neverything is practical everything is\nreal it's exactly how you see it the\nbackground everything you see in this\nFrame a YouTube video for example might\nbe totally practical that's level one\nlevel two is where some of the things\nyou're seeing in the video are virtual\nmaybe it's a blue screen or green screen\nmaybe it's a virtual animal or a some\nmagical video animation or some Motion\nGraphics or things like that but then\nnumber three\nthe top level would be fully virtual\ncompletely unreal as I would say think\nlike The Lion King or Avatar so I\nrecently got to visit a studio space in\nBrooklyn New York called zero space that\nhas something called an XR stage and\nthis thing is somewhere right on the\nborder blurring a line between level two\nand level three it's kinda real but\ntechnically not real so there are a\nwhole bunch of shows and and things you\nprobably watch right now the Mandalorian\nbeing probably the most famous among\nthem that use this version of virtual\nproduction so I mentioned the green\nscreens or blue screens earlier these\nare obviously cool because in the edit\nyou can replace anything that's the\ncolor green with whatever you want maybe\na new background or environment and then\nif the actors are good enough they can\nact like that environment is really\naround them but this is next level so\nthis is the XR stage what you're looking\nat is a 50 plus foot 8K video wall very\nexpensive but absolutely loaded with\nTech when you point cameras at them and\nthe advantages are very real so number\none the actors or anyone in front of the\nscreen can actually have an easier time\ninteracting with their environment\nbecause they can actually see it instead\nof imagining you know a totally\ndifferent environment when there's just\nlike a bunch of green and some trackers\nBend number two the camera's position in\nspace is actually tracked with this\nlittle piece here from Red spy on top of\nthe camera and that information is\nrelayed in real time back to the display\nso the background actually moves when\nthe camera moves now this is huge so if\nyou build a volumetric environment a 3D\nenvironment in something like Unreal\nEngine the camera movement maintains\nthis Parallax effect and looks super\nrealistic like you're actually in a new\nspace unlike what I did in the intro\nwhich was just sort of like a taste of\nwhat it's capable of with a flat image\nso then number three and there's\nactually a huge one if you're an editor\nthere's no green spill like if you've\never tried to edit Green Screen Video\nyou already know it takes a lot of\ntalent and editing to fully remove the\nbackground green and even still there's\noccasional green light spilling onto\nFabric and skin and like glass and\nReflections and things like that the\nlast two percent of green but with the\nvideo wall there is no green spill well\nactually there is Spill but it isn't\ngreen it's just light that perfectly\nmatches your environment there's\nactually all kinds of extra lights and\nthings like that around the set as well\neven a ceiling display to make this\nhappen so all of the lights and all the\ncolors of light hitting the person in\nthe environment will look just exactly\nlike they're supposed to as if they were\nactually in that space so all of that is\nawesome but\nthe most impressive thing that I learned\nwhile I was there and this really blew\nmy mind is you already know you can have\na camera and then a person and then a\nbackground video wall and then as the\ncamera is moving around The Parallax\neffect matches to show what the camera\nshould see in real time\nbut this setup can actually do more than\none camera\nat the same time and if you're thinking\nwait a second how can two different\ncameras how can how can that background\nmoving effect work with two different\ncamera angles at the same time won't one\nof them always be wrong or what happens\nif they they overlap\nand this is where it gets crazy so this\ngiant 8K video wall is refreshing at 120\nframes per second so as there are two\ndifferent cameras pointed at it each\ncamera is shooting 60 FPS but they're\nsynced up so that they're actually each\nshooting alternating frames\nI'm going to say that again each camera\nis shooting 60 FPS but they're not\nshooting the same 60 FPS so it's almost\nas if like one blinks while the other\nshoots a frame and then the other blinks\nwhile the other shoots a frame and they\ngo back and forth and so both cameras\ncan be pointed at the same wall at the\nsame time and see completely different\nthings so that solves the problem for\ntwo different video cameras both motion\ntracking correctly at the same time\nmatter of fact this particular display\nthis serospace has can go up to 180\nframes per second which can accommodate\nsix different motion tracked cameras all\nshooting 30 FPS the crack frame rate all\nat the same time and all seeing six\ndifferent things so I got to explore the\nspace with fellow Creator Cleo Abram and\nshe's put together an awesome video on\nher Channel huge if true it really blew\nour minds that this worked so well and\nthat you know even to our natural our\nnaked eye like things could kind of to\nblend and you can kind of see that two\nthings are happening at once but\nabsolutely nothing that one camera sees\nbleeds into what the other camera sees\nwe literally had them light up the\ndisplay behind us and it showed up as a\nperfectly blue blue screen on One camera\nand a perfectly green green screen to a\ndifferent camera at the same time and it\njust showed up as like kind of bluish\ngreenish to our eyes so seeing this then\nall the gears start turning about all\nthe ways you could use this I just\nimagine you have you know the crazy\ndesert background of the Mandalorian but\nthe lines for the actors to read are on\nthe wall but the cameras can't see them\nor tracking points or just all kinds of\nit's so so many things you can do with\nit it really got me thinking of if\nthere's a way that we could use some\nsort of some parts of this in our own\nspace obviously we build\nthese are real sets they're not virtual\nsets but I just you know I want to think\nabout ways and maybe I could do\nsomething like this in our own space\nanyway do yourself a favor and watch\nclio's video which is also going live\ntoday we got even way more into the\ndetails and some real world examples of\nthe XR stage plus a bunch of other\ninteresting examples of virtual\nproduction techniques complete with\nanimations and more mind-blowing video\nfacts literally as soon as you finish\nthis video it'll be the first link of\nthe like button click that watch hers\nit's so worth it and Shout out again to\nzerospace for letting us explore again\nI'm I'm gonna probably be back in touch\nwith you guys I'm gonna try to figure\nout a way to make that happen here\nsomehow\nsome way okay next one hard pivot to a\npiece of tech that I've been using\nactually for a while it's a piece of\nHome Tech that's why I'm home for this\none and uh sleeping Tech actually when I\nwas first told about the existence of\nthis piece of tech I was kind of\nsurprised about it but then I had a lot\nof questions and so when eight sleep\nreached out and wanted to sponsor this\nvideo and they had all the answers well\nI was very interested so you might have\nheard of ate sleep they're kind of\nblowing up recently but basically the\nmain thing they make is a temperature\ncontrolled bed actually it's a Topper so\nwhat it does is it wraps around your\ncurrent mattress it's called a pod cover\nand the main feature the idea is it\ncompletely controls the temperature of\nthe surface of your bed so it can be\nnice and crisp and cool when you first\nclimb into bed and then nice and warm in\nthe morning and make it easier to get\nout of bed which is pretty awesome I\nfeel like there's two types of people\npeople that fall asleep instantly in\nlike five minutes and then people who\nthink it's like a superpower to be able\nto fall asleep instantly and that's me\nI'm in the second group for sure I've\nhistorically took at least half an hour\nto fall asleep anytime but science shows\npretty definitively you've probably\nheard this before that cool temperatures\nare pretty ideal for falling asleep\nquickly and then staying asleep and\nbeing well rested basically that\ntemperature is one of the absolute top\nfactors for quality of sleep so the\neight sleep basically what it is it's\nthis box next to the bed which has much\nstuff in it a compressor a reservoir and\na whole computer it barely makes a\nwhisper of noise and that connects to\nthe bed via tubes and then the whole top\nof this bed this cover is lined with\nthese capillaries through the whole\nthing these veins for either the warm or\ncooled water to flow through and\nimportantly there's two halves so if you\nsleep at a different temperature from\nyour partner which let's be honest I\nfeel like everyone says they do then you\ncan have each side of the bed be a\ndifferent temperature and on the piece\nthat brings it all together is this app\non the phone and it lets you basically\nturn a dial to bring it between\n-10 and 10 those are the levels of\ntemperature and that signifies basically\n55 degrees Fahrenheit all the way at the\nbottom which is pretty chill all the way\nup to 110 degrees Fahrenheit at plus 10\nwhich is straight up hot so I don't need\nnearly that much range but it's nice to\nhave I go to sleep at -4 and I warm up\nto plus two that's as warm as I really\never need it but yeah I guess now I can\nsay my bed this bed is literally water\ncooled so that's pretty sick so the\nthing is once you've used it for I think\nabout a week basically it settles into a\nroutine where it cools down before you\nget into bed and slowly adjust\ntemperature over the course of the night\nthey call it autopilot I think but there\nare different stages of sleep where\nit'll slowly warm up overnight until\nit's at the temperature that you want to\nwake up at but then on top of that\nthere's a host of other features that\nare in the eight sleep membership which\nis a monthly subscription which I don't\nlove but it actually has a bunch of\nreally useful features so the first is\nautopilot which I talked about but then\nthe second there are a bunch of these\nsleep tracking features I typically warn\nthe Apple watch to sleep for the past\ncouple months and it's on your wrist and\nit can read a bunch of things about you\nfrom your wrist but clearly the best\nthing to measure your sleep would be the\nthing you sleep on so the mattress\nitself so we can tell when you get into\nbed of course when you get up and it\ngrafts out when you're in these\ndifferent stages of sleep through the\nnight it even somehow measures your\nheart rate and breathing rate if you\nwant it to and then it does a good job\nin the UI of highlighting with like\nlittle green or red markers when things\nare going well and when things are a\nlittle bit off so you can see here on\nthis terrible night of sleep I had that\nthere are certain things clearly that I\ndidn't do well like I went to sleep late\ndespite waking up at a normal time and I\nfell asleep quickly but I took a while\nto get up so the next night of sleep you\ncan see was much better whole bunch of\ngreen here basically Flawless it also\nhas a vibration alarm it will literally\nlightly vibrate just your side of the\nbed to wake you up silently which is\npretty sick and it also gets continuous\nsoftware updates over time honestly this\nthing has been pretty awesome for me\npersonally over the past couple of weeks\nthat I've had it like I said I've had it\nfor a while the one thing that I feel\nlike is pretty definitive proof for me\nanyway that it's working or helping me\nsleep better uh the Apple watch likes to\ntell me when I have a low heart rate\nwhen I when I go below 40 beats per\nminute for a long time it gives me a low\nheart rate notification but that's\nactually potentially a good thing if\nyou're recovering well and the first\nweek or two after I started sleeping\nwell with the cooled mattress I would\nwake up with like 10 to 15 low heart\nrate notifications which meant that my\nheart rate was getting lower and I was\nrecovering better and sleeping better\nwhich is pretty cool so in an age where\nhumans are basically sleeping worse than\never before with all the tech around us\nall the screens that are around us every\nnight it's pretty cool to have a piece\nof tech that actually helps us sleep\nbetter at least it helps me anyway you\ncan try it too if you want to you can\nget 200 off by using the code MKBHD on\ntheir site I definitely think this\nqualifies as dope Tech\nokay last but not least how about a\nlittle bit of an exclusive\nthis is your first look at the nothing\nphone 2.\nwhich looks a lot like the nothing fun\none but you guys have heard a lot of the\nhype you've seen some of the teasers so\nlet me show you what I am allowed to\nshow you of what's new so this is the\nphone one here with the glyphs and the\nlights on the back and this is the phone\ntoo slightly tweaked design definitely\nnothing dramatic at first glance here\nsince they're trying to establish their\nvisual design as a young company you\nknow you can't go dramatically changing\nit every time but same shapes slightly\nlighter gray slightly more rounded glass\nactually on the back but we'll get to\nall that in the full review video of\nthis phone for now in this exclusive I\ncan show you what's actually new with\nthe glyph interface the actual lights on\nthe back so first of all nothing fun one\nhad five strips of white LEDs with this\npattern with this new one the shapes are\nin the same place but there are some\ntweaks you can see the arc around the\ncamera is split into two strips and the\nbig one in the middle is now separated\nout into six pieces these are all still\nwhite LEDs no color or RGB or anything\ncrazy but the main Improvement is\nactually just that there are more\naddressable LED zones inside of each of\nthe strips which is kind of fun so you\nprobably remember you could already use\nthe bottom exclamation mark as a\ncharging progress indicator that does\nstill work so before the entire back of\nthe phone had a total of 12 different\nLED lighting zones controllable by the\nsoftware this new one has a total of 33\nacross the back and just this strip up\nhere at the top uh gets 16 to itself so\nit's much more precise and granular and\nso they've designed some features\nactually around using that as a progress\nindicator so there's a volume indicator\nnow so when you have media playing it\nliterally just shows your volume level\nand as you move it up and down you can\nsee that light go up and down with it\nthere's a glyph timer built in so you\ncan set a timer to a predetermined\nlength of time using the UI then flip\nthe phone over to start the timer and\nyou can see it slowly rolls down through\nthe LEDs to count down and give you a\nvisual indicator of when the timer will\nbe over I kind of like this one for\nworking those of you who use the\nPomodoro Technique will probably find\nthis useful and there's also plans for\nthis to be addressable by Third parties\nso you can imagine so Uber and zamato\nare the only two that are signed up\nright now but kind of the same way Apple\nhad to get developers on board with\ntheir live activities in iOS same idea\nyou can imagine waiting for an Uber and\nturning the phone down and sort of\nseeing the progress of when the car gets\ncloser and closer until it arrives\nthings like that ideally they can get\nmore on board for things that just make\nsense for Progress bar stuff now you\nmight remember last time I was I was\nspecifically asking for more\ncustomization stuff so I could tell what\napp I was getting a notification from\nwithout flipping the phone over\nthis is still all white LEDs there's no\ncolors or anything like that but there\nis one new feature called essential\nnotifications where basically if you\nhave a certain app that's important to\nyou that you get notifications from\nit'll stay lit up in this corner strip\nand this stays lit until that\nnotification is addressed so it's not\nfully customizable like I can't assign a\ndifferent app to each of the different\nlighting zones but for at least this one\napp you'll always know when you've got a\nnotification from it and then they also\nadded this neat little glyph composer so\nif you want to literally design your own\nringtone you can go full DJ mode\nso that is your first look at the glyph\nupdate on the back of the new nothing\nphone 2.\nstill sort of like on the borderline\nbetween gimmick and useful for a lot of\npeople but it is at least a little bit\nmore customizable and you'll have to get\nsubscribed to see all the rest of the\nnew stuff with this phone except you'll\nknow what I've been finding in my\ntesting that's coming up the sub button\nis below of course but that's been it\nthanks for watching dope Tech\ncatch you guys the next one\npeace\n", "punctuated_text": "hey, what's up. I'm Kim HD here. welcome back to dope Tech. this we already know. Tech and production value is already some of the most fun stuff we do here, and I remember one of my favorite episodes of this we ever did was playing with the cinema robots in Portland and by the end thinking it's crazy. but I think we might have to get one of these things and I have a sneaky feeling that might be happening again on this shoot, because, well, this isn't my normal Studio, as you may have thought- could get interesting. all right, welcome back to another episode of dope Tech. I've got three really interesting things I want to show you guys for this one. the first one, as you can probably already tell, is a piece of video production Tech. I get unnecessarily excited about the bleeding edge of production video stuff, but this, this is a whole different kind of production. this would be what's referred to as virtual production. so let's rewind for a second. I want to oversimplify, but I think there's basically three different types of three different levels of production, level one being: everything is practical, everything is real, it's exactly how you see it, the background, everything you see in this Frame- a YouTube video, for example- might be totally practical. that's level one. level two is where some of the things you're seeing in the video are virtual. maybe it's a blue screen or green screen, maybe it's a virtual animal or a, some magical video animation or some Motion Graphics or things like that. but then number three, the top level, would be fully virtual, completely unreal, as I would say. think like The Lion King or Avatar. so I recently got to visit a studio space in Brooklyn, New York, called zero space that has something called an XR stage, and this thing is somewhere right on the border, blurring a line between level two and level three. it's kinda real but technically not real. so there are a whole bunch of shows and and things you probably watch right now- the Mandalorian being probably the most famous among them- that use this version of virtual production. so I mentioned the green screens or blue screens earlier. these are obviously cool because in the edit you can replace anything that's the color green with whatever you want, maybe a new background or environment, and then, if the actors are good enough, they can act like that environment is really around them. but this is next level. so this is the XR stage. what you're looking at is a 50 plus foot 8K video wall- very expensive, but absolutely loaded with Tech when you point cameras at them, and the advantages are very real. so, number one: the actors or anyone in front of the screen can actually have an easier time interacting with their environment because they can actually see it instead of imagining. you know a totally different environment when there's just like a bunch of green and some trackers Bend. number two: the camera's position in space is actually tracked with this little piece here from Red spy on top of the camera, and that information is relayed in real time back to the display, so the background actually moves when the camera moves. now, this is huge. so if you build a volumetric environment, a 3D environment in something like Unreal Engine, the camera movement maintains this Parallax effect and looks super realistic, like you're actually in a new space, unlike what I did in the intro, which was just sort of like a taste of what it's capable of with a flat image. so then number three- and there's actually a huge one, if you're an editor, there's no green spill like. if you've ever tried to edit Green Screen Video, you already know it takes a lot of talent and editing to fully remove the background green and even still there's occasional green light spilling onto Fabric and skin and like glass and Reflections and things like that- the last two percent of green. but with the video wall there is no green spill. well, actually there is Spill, but it isn't green, it's just light that perfectly matches your environment. there's actually all kinds of extra lights and things like that around the set as well, even a ceiling display to make this happen, so all of the lights and all the colors of light hitting the person in the environment will look just exactly like they're supposed to, as if they were actually in that space. so all of that is awesome. but the most impressive thing that I learned while I was there- and this really blew my mind- is: you already know you can have a camera and then a person, and then a background video wall and then, as the camera is moving around, The Parallax effect matches to show what the camera should see in real time. but this setup can actually do more than one camera at the same time. and if you're thinking, wait a second, how can two different cameras? how can, how can that background moving effect work with two different camera angles at the same time? won't one of them always be wrong? or what happens if they they overlap, and this is where it gets crazy. so this giant 8K video wall is refreshing at 120 frames per second. so, as there are two different cameras pointed at it, each camera is shooting 60 FPS, but they're synced up so that they're actually each shooting alternating frames. I'm going to say that again, each camera is shooting 60 FPS, but they're not shooting the same 60 FPS, so it's almost as if, like one blinks while the other shoots a frame, and then the other blinks while the other shoots a frame, and they go back and forth and so both cameras can be pointed at the same wall at the same time and see completely different things. so that solves the problem for two different video cameras, both motion tracking correctly, at the same time. matter of fact, this particular display, this serospace has, can go up to 180 frames per second, which can accommodate six different motion tracked cameras all shooting 30 FPS, the crack frame rate, all at the same time and all seeing six different things. so I got to explore the space with fellow Creator, Cleo Abram, and she's put together an awesome video on her Channel- huge, if true. it really blew our minds that this worked so well and that, you know, even to our natural, our naked eye, like things could kind of to blend and you can kind of see that two things are happening at once, but absolutely nothing that one camera sees bleeds into what the other camera sees. we literally had them light up the display behind us and it showed up as a perfectly blue blue screen on One camera and a perfectly green green screen to a different camera at the same time, and it just showed up as like kind of bluish, greenish to our eyes. so, seeing this, then all the gears start turning about all the ways you could use this. I just imagine you have, you know, the crazy desert background of the Mandalorian, but the lines for the actors to read are on the wall but the cameras can't see them, or tracking points or just all kinds of it's. so so many things you can do with it. it really got me thinking of if there's a way that we could use some sort of, some parts of this in our own space. obviously we build- these are real sets, they're not virtual sets- but I just, you know, I want to think about ways and maybe I could do something like this in our own space. anyway, do yourself a favor and watch clio's video, which is also going live today. we got even way more into the details and some real world examples of the XR stage, plus a bunch of other interesting examples of virtual production techniques, complete with animations and more mind-blowing video facts. literally as soon as you finish this video, it'll be the first link of the like button. click that, watch hers, it's so worth it. and Shout out again to zerospace for letting us explore again. I'm I'm gonna probably be back in touch with you guys. I'm gonna try to figure out a way to make that happen here, somehow, some way. okay, next, one hard pivot to a piece of tech that I've been using, actually for a while. it's a piece of Home Tech- that's why I'm home for this one- and, uh, sleeping Tech. actually, when I was first told about the existence of this piece of tech, I was kind of surprised about it, but then I had a lot of questions, and so when eight sleep reached out and wanted to sponsor this video and they had all the answers, well, I was very interested. so you might have heard of ate sleep. they're kind of blowing up recently, but basically the main thing they make is a temperature controlled bed. actually, it's a Topper. so what it does is it wraps around your current mattress. it's called a pod cover and the main feature, the idea, is it completely controls the temperature of the surface of your bed so it can be nice and crisp and cool when you first climb into bed and then nice and warm in the morning and make it easier to get out of bed, which is pretty awesome. I feel like there's two types of people: people that fall asleep instantly, in like five minutes, and then people who think it's like a superpower to be able to fall asleep instantly, and that's me. I'm in the second group for sure. I've historically took at least half an hour to fall asleep anytime. but science shows pretty definitively- you've probably heard this before- that cool temperatures are pretty ideal for falling asleep quickly and then staying asleep and being well rested. basically, that temperature is one of the absolute top factors for quality of sleep. so the eight sleep. basically what it is. it's this box next to the bed which has much stuff in it: a compressor, a reservoir and a whole computer. it barely makes a whisper of noise and that connects to the bed via tubes. and then the whole top of this bed, this cover, is lined with these capillaries through the whole thing, these veins for either the warm or cooled water to flow through and, importantly, there's two halves. so if you sleep at a different temperature from your partner- which, let's be honest, I feel like everyone says they do- then you can have each side of the bed be a different temperature and on the piece that brings it all together is this app on the phone and it lets you basically turn a dial to bring it between -10 and 10. those are the levels of temperature and that signifies basically 55 degrees Fahrenheit all the way at the bottom, which is pretty chill, all the way up to 110 degrees Fahrenheit at plus 10, which is straight up hot. so I don't need nearly that much range, but it's nice to have. I go to sleep at -4 and I warm up to plus two. that's as warm as I really ever need it. but yeah, I guess now I can say my bed, this bed, is literally water cooled, so that's pretty sick. so the thing is, once you've used it for, I think, about a week, basically, it settles into a routine where it cools down before you get into bed and slowly adjust temperature over the course of the night. they call it autopilot, I think. but there are different stages of sleep where it'll slowly warm up overnight until it's at the temperature that you want to wake up at, but then on top of that, there's a host of other features that are in the eight sleep membership, which is a monthly subscription, which I don't love, but it actually has a bunch of really useful features. so the first is autopilot, which I talked about, but then the second, there are a bunch of these sleep tracking features. I typically warn the Apple watch to sleep for the past couple months and it's on your wrist and it can read a bunch of things about you from your wrist. but clearly the best thing to measure your sleep would be the thing you sleep on, so the mattress itself. so we can tell when you get into bed, of course, when you get up, and it grafts out when you're in these different stages of sleep through the night. it even somehow measures your heart rate and breathing rate, if you want it to, and then it does a good job in the UI of highlighting with like little green or red markers when things are going well and when things are a little bit off. so you can see here on this terrible night of sleep I had that. there are certain things, clearly, that I didn't do well, like I went to sleep late, despite waking up at a normal time, and I fell asleep quickly but I took a while to get up. so the next night of sleep, you can see, was much better. whole bunch of green here, basically Flawless. it also has a vibration alarm. it will literally lightly vibrate just your side of the bed to wake you up silently, which is pretty sick, and it also gets continuous software updates over time. honestly, this thing has been pretty awesome for me personally over the past couple of weeks that I've had it. like I said, I've had it for a while. the one thing that I feel like is pretty definitive proof for me anyway, that it's working or helping me sleep better. uh, the Apple watch likes to tell me when I have a low heart rate, when I, when I go below 40 beats per minute for a long time, it gives me a low heart rate notification. but that's actually potentially a good thing if you're recovering well, and the first week or two after I started sleeping well with the cooled mattress, I would wake up with like 10 to 15 low heart rate notifications, which meant that my heart rate was getting lower and I was recovering better and sleeping better, which is pretty cool. so in an age where humans are basically sleeping worse than ever before, with all the tech around us, all the screens that are around us every night, it's pretty cool to have a piece of tech that actually helps us sleep better. at least it helps me anyway. you can try it too. if you want to. you can get 200 off by using the code MKBHD on their site. I definitely think this qualifies as dope Tech. okay, last but not least, how about a little bit of an exclusive? this is your first look at the nothing phone 2. which looks a lot like the nothing fun one. but you guys have heard a lot of the hype, you've seen some of the teasers, so let me show you what I am allowed to show you of what's new. so this is the phone one here with the glyphs and the lights on the back. and this is the phone too. slightly tweaked design. definitely nothing dramatic at first glance here, since they're trying to establish their visual design. as a young company, you know you can't go dramatically changing it every time, but same shapes, slightly lighter gray, slightly more rounded glass actually on the back. but we'll get to all that in the full review video of this phone. for now, in this exclusive, I can show you what's actually new with the glyph interface: the actual lights on the back. so first of all, nothing fun. one had five strips of white LEDs with this pattern. with this new one, the shapes are in the same place, but there are some tweaks. you can see the arc around the camera is split into two strips and the big one in the middle is now separated out into six pieces. these are all still white LEDs, no color or RGB or anything crazy. but the main Improvement is actually just that there are more addressable LED zones inside of each of the strips, which is kind of fun. so you probably remember you could already use the bottom exclamation mark as a charging progress indicator. that does still work. so before, the entire back of the phone had a total of 12 different LED lighting zones controllable by the software. this new one has a total of 33 across the back and just this strip up here at the top, uh, gets 16 to itself. so it's much more precise and granular, and so they've designed some features actually around using that as a progress indicator. so there's a volume indicator now. so when you have media playing, it literally just shows your volume level and as you move it up and down you can see that light go up and down with it. there's a glyph timer built in so you can set a timer to a predetermined length of time using the UI. then flip the phone over to start the timer and you can see it slowly rolls down through the LEDs to count down and give you a visual indicator of when the timer will be over. I kind of like this one for working. those of you who use the Pomodoro Technique will probably find this useful, and there's also plans for this to be addressable by Third parties, so you can imagine. so Uber and zamato are the only two that are signed up right now. but kind of the same way Apple had to get developers on board with their live activities in iOS. same idea. you can imagine waiting for an Uber and turning the phone down and sort of seeing the progress of when the car gets closer and closer until it arrives, things like that. ideally they can get more on board for things that just make sense, for Progress bar stuff. now you might remember last time I was, I was specifically asking for more customization stuff so I could tell what app I was getting a notification from without flipping the phone over. this is still all white LEDs, there's no colors or anything like that. but there is one new feature called essential notifications where basically if you have a certain app that's important to you that you get notifications from, it'll stay lit up in this corner strip and this stays lit until that notification is addressed. so it's not fully customizable, like I can't assign a different app to each of the different lighting zones, but for at least this one app you'll always know when you've got a notification from it. and then they also added this neat little glyph composer, so if you want to literally design your own ringtone, you can go full DJ mode. so that is your first look at the glyph update on the back of the new nothing phone 2.. still sort of like on the borderline between gimmick and useful for a lot of people, but it is at least a little bit more customizable. and you'll have to get subscribed to see all the rest of the new stuff with this phone. except you'll know what I've been finding in my testing. that's coming up. the sub button is below, of course, but that's been it, thanks for watching dope Tech. catch you guys. the next one, peace."}, {"title": "Why Does the M2 Mac Pro Exist?", "description": "In a world where you can get the exact same performance from a computer half the price... what's the point?\n\nMKBHD Merch:

"[Music]", "start": 670.07, "duration": 10.4}], "text": "[Music]\nso Apple's done it they finally\ncompleted their apple silicon transition\nthey said it would take two years it\ntook closer to three but now every\nsingle Mac that was running Intel\nprocessors just a few short years ago is\nrunning Apple silicon from the top to\nthe bottom of their lineup and the very\nlast one to get it was this one right\nhere the new Apple silicon Mac Pro and\nit got it in a weird way so let's talk\nabout it so there's a whole lineup of\nMax and the bottom of the lineup was the\nMacBook Air and the Mac Mini getting M1\nand then M2 just this the base smallest\nversion of Apple silicon on a chip\nalready a massive improvement over the\nIntel machines but then the further up\nyou go you get the MacBook Pros with M2\nPro this is double the M2 then the M2\nMax is again double the M2 Pro and at\nthe top of the lineup is the new King of\nthe Hill most powerful chip they make in\nthe new Max studio which is called the\nM2 Ultra which again double levels up\nthe M2 Max literally I mean it's two M2\nMaxes fused together this ship is\nabsurdly impressive which shouldn't be a\nsurprise I mean the M1 Ultra was already\nawesome and it's what I've been editing\non for basically the past year it's been\nout but M2 Ultra is actually\nmeaningfully better at a lot of stuff\nthan that one it's a solid 15 to 20\nfaster on single core performance which\nis already excellent taking it to the\nhighest Mark of any Mac ever and it also\nbenchmarked 15 to 20 faster in\nmulti-core CPU performance again making\nit the fastest Mac ever tested it got\nbetter scores in everything across the\nboard geekbench metal scores are up by\n20 in the GPU department now that it has\nthis new 76 core GPU which is the one\nI'm testing and there are even certain\nsoftware optimizations that improve\nworkflows even more than expected so the\nNew Media engine is a good one where it\nwould typically Excel mainly at parallel\nworkloads like that's why you'd always\nsee them talking about 22 8K prores\nvideos at the same time or whatever it\nwas but it can now also Point all of its\ncore is at a single workload for those\nof us doing back-to-back exports instead\nof parallel exports so the export time\nfor a sample project I built with five\nminute prores video went down from a\nridiculous one minute 45 seconds all the\nway down to a hilariously fast 57\nseconds which is something like an 80\nImprovement it's amazing M2 Ultra is\ntruly excellent so then the Mac Pro\nwould be the last Mac to get the Apple\nsilicon upgrade and when it finally did\nlook a lot of us Hardware nerds were\ngetting really excited about maybe\nsomething like a M2 extreme which would\nonce again double the M2 Ultra chip by\nfusing two together and being just\nsomething Mammoth and absurd\nbut it didn't\nit didn't it's actually the exact same\nM2 Ultra chip in both the Mac Studio and\nthe new Mac Pro so the natural question\nthat this begs is why would anyone buy\nthe new Mac Pro like why would anyone in\ntheir right mind spend 3 000 more\ndollars on a machine that gives you the\nexact same performance from the exact\nsame chip in a much bigger heavier\nmachine well I'll tell you why because I\nam one of them one of the few I'll warn\nyou but one of the few people that will\nactually take advantage of some unique\nthings about this new Mac Pro but the\nfact is yeah most people shouldn't and\nwon't get the new Mac Pro because the\nMac Studio exists so what's the reason\nwell there are some smaller details that\nare potentially interesting about the\nnew Mac Pro like for example okay it's\nthe same chip in each but hang on a\nsecond they're dramatically different\nsizes so maybe the Mac Pro in a much\nbigger chassis with three gigantic fans\nat the front and way more space for\nairflow surely there's a slight thermal\nadvantage to getting the Mac Pro or\nmaybe more sustained performance over a\nlonger time before throttling and\ntechnically yes I found that to be\nslightly True by only like a single\ndigit percentage in most cases and often\nby a rounding error but I did do the\ncinebench 10 minute stress test back to\nback three times each on the Mac Pro and\nthe Mac Studio and while the Mac Studio\ndropped a tiny bit on the second run and\nthe Mac Pro technically increased\nslightly with each run suggesting it\nwasn't near its limit yet it wasn't\nreally that dramatic like I've seen some\npeople get maybe closer to eight to ten\npercent out of their tests but it's not\nenough to spend three thousand more\ndollars for more performance out of this\nmachine put it that way but another\nthing is there is more i o on the Mac\nPro technically I mean it doesn't have\nthe SD card slot on the front\nunfortunately which is one of the most\nimportant ones but it does have a new\ncard at the top here with six\nThunderbolt ports and two more at the\nfront so totaling eight which is two\nmore than the Mac Studio and it also has\nhas two HDMI 2.1 ports instead of one\nand two ethernet ports instead of one so\ntechnically true yes but also you\nwouldn't spend three thousand dollars\nmore on the Mac Pro just for that I\nthink people would get dongles for one\nextra Port but no the real difference\nthe reason the Mac Pro exists is PCI\nslots like that's that's really it like\nthe next time you see a comment or a\ntweet or something of someone going why\ndoes the Mac Pro even exist when you can\nget the same computer in a Mac Studio is\nbecause this one has PCI slots that's\nthe real reason the Mac Pro has six open\nPCI expansion slots that the Mac Studio\ndoes not have five of them PCI Gen 4 the\nlast one a compatibility slot it's kind\nof funny how empty it looks when you get\nit like you open this computer up and\nthe entire thing is just air the M2\nUltra is just under this cooler at the\ntop the CPU GPU shared memory the media\nengine neural engine everything is just\nunder there and then there's just an\nexpansive room for all these PCI slots\nand these PCI slots aren't even for\nvideo cards or gpus at all actually\nbecause as we know the GPU which has 192\nup to 192 gigs of shared memory is built\ninto the Apple silicon chip so really\nall we're getting the PCI slots for is\nexpansion slots the pure dedicated\nexpansion slots that a lot of Pros in\ncertain industries use a lot sound cards\ni o cards storage cards networking cards\nthat's it so yeah it is really specific\nand it will sound ridiculous to most\npeople that it literally doesn't support\nvideo cards like you could pull a crazy\nAMD Radeon card out of the Old Mac Pro\nright now and put it into this thing and\nbasically nothing would happen but also\nat the same time most of the buyers of\nthese Mac Pros are you know Production\nStudios post Houses music studios things\nlike that those people already had\ndesktops with PCI slots and they\nliterally could not make a Mac work\nunless they made one with PCI slots so\nthat's who Mac Pro is for it really is\ntoo bad though that technically this Mac\nPro will be less versatile than the old\none because there are people who would\nwant to throw powerful GPU cores at\ncertain applications whether it's after\neffects or some 3D modeling stuff or\nPremiere even that just can't do that\nwith this one it also doesn't work with\nor apparently even need the old After\nBurner carts so I don't know if you\nremember the afterburner cards and the\nold Mac Pro were basically these\ndedicated cars a two thousand dollar\nvideo accelerator card uh but apparently\nthe M2 Ultra has enough power that it's\nthe equivalent of like seven afterburner\ncards so that right there is the real\npower of Apple silicon if you're\nshooting prores but the more I think\nabout it just so much of this Pro\nmachine stuff is specific to workflows\nand it's it's very difficult to build\none computer with no expansion or\nupgrade ability or modularity at all\nthat works with everyone's workflows so\nthere did need to exist a Mac that could\naccommodate some more interesting\nworkflows but like I don't shoot prores\nI shoot r3d so I'm not going to need the\nexact machine that's built super well\nfor Pro for me it's actually storage uh\nright here I'm holding owc's 8m2 PCI SSD\nthis is basically a PCI expansion card\nwith a bunch of nvme ssds on it so the\nmax storage you can get built into the\nMac Pro is eight terabytes and it's\npretty fast it's six seven thousand\nmegabytes per second read write cool\nuh but you can max out one of these\ncards at 64 terabytes and it will read\nright at 25\n000 megabytes per second\nwhich is absurd uh so that's a totally\ndifferent level this is what I'm going\nto dump footage on this is what I'm\ngoing to back up to this is going to\nreplace my current external Thunderbolt\nbackup which is where I was keeping all\nmy old footage it was sitting next to\nthe Mac Studio plugged in and I'll still\nhave plenty of room left over to work on\nand edit multiple video projects off of\nit at the same time it's going to be\nawesome for what I do and I only need\none but also I fully acknowledge and you\nshould all realize that most people\ndon't need those specialized ssds that's\nwhy it looks crazy that this Mac Pro\nexists just on the website next to all\nthe rest of the Macs but most people\nshould get this one Mac Studio is kind\nof a revelation for Apple it's offering\ntheir top of the lineup performance for\nway less than the old top of the lineup\nand that's why most people should end up\ngetting that one I do have one last\nthing though\nI have a theory\nif if I know anything about Apple it's\nthat you can sort of predict the future\npretty well based on the past\nand this Mac Pro\nis a pretty classic lazy refresh from\nApple\npretty similar to what they've already\ndone like look at the MacBook Air when\nthey first went

generation of it got the\nredesign same thing with the MacBook Pro\nright they took the MacBook Pro with the\ntouch bar and just reused the same\ndesign new chip and then the next\nGeneration got a

already thinking about the M3 and\nthat's probably kind of unhealthy but\nthat's that's where my mind goes that's\njust my theory so anyway now you know\nwhy the macro exists now you know why\nI'll have one on my desk and I'll also\nleave you with this there was no other\nplace to put it in the review but I did\nrealize that this Mac Pro does something\nkind of weird when you take the

"[Music]. so Apple's done it. they finally completed their apple silicon transition. they said it would take two years. it took closer to three, but now every single Mac that was running Intel processors just a few short years ago is running Apple silicon from the top to the bottom of their lineup. and the very last one to get it was this one right here, the new Apple silicon Mac Pro, and it got it in a weird way. so let's talk about it. so there's a whole lineup of Max, and the bottom of the lineup was the MacBook Air and the Mac Mini, getting M1 and then M2- just this, the base, smallest version of Apple silicon on a chip- already a massive improvement over the Intel machines. but then the further up you go, you get the MacBook Pros with M2 Pro. this is double the M2, then the M2 Max is again double the M2 Pro, and at the top of the lineup is the new King of the Hill, most powerful chip they make in the new Max studio, which is called the M2 Ultra, which again double levels up the M2 Max. literally. I mean it's two M2 Maxes fused together. this ship is absurdly impressive, which shouldn't be a surprise. I mean, the M1 Ultra was already awesome and it's what I've been editing on for basically the past year it's been out, but M2 Ultra is actually meaningfully better at a lot of stuff than that one. it's a solid 15 to 20 faster on single core performance, which is already excellent, taking it to the highest Mark of any Mac ever, and it also benchmarked 15 to 20 faster in multi-core CPU performance, again making it the fastest Mac ever tested. it got better scores in everything across the board. geekbench metal scores are up by 20 in the GPU department now that it has this new 76 core GPU, which is the one I'm testing, and there are even certain software optimizations that improve workflows even more than expected. so the New Media engine is a good one where it would typically Excel mainly at parallel workloads- like that's why you'd always see them talking about 22 8K prores videos at the same time or whatever it was- but it can now also Point all of its core is at a single workload for those of us doing back-to-back exports instead of parallel exports. so the export time for a sample project I built with five minute prores video went down from a ridiculous one minute 45 seconds all the way down to a hilariously fast 57 seconds, which is something like an 80 Improvement. it's amazing. M2 Ultra is truly excellent. so then, the Mac Pro would be the last Mac to get the Apple silicon upgrade. and when it finally did look, a lot of us Hardware nerds were getting really excited about maybe something like a M2 extreme, which would once again double the M2 Ultra chip by fusing two together and being just something Mammoth and absurd. but it didn't. it didn't? it's actually the exact same M2 Ultra chip in both the Mac Studio and the new Mac Pro. so the natural question that this begs is: why would anyone buy the new Mac Pro like? why would anyone in their right mind spend 3 000 more dollars on a machine that gives you the exact same performance from the exact same chip in a much bigger, heavier machine? well, I'll tell you why, because I am one of them- one of the few, I'll warn you, but one of the few people that will actually take advantage of some unique things about this new Mac Pro. but the fact is, yeah, most people shouldn't and won't get the new Mac Pro because the Mac Studio exists. so what's the reason? well, there are some smaller details that are potentially interesting about the new Mac Pro, like, for example: okay, it's the same chip in each. but hang on a second, they're dramatically different sizes. so maybe the Mac Pro in a much bigger chassis with three gigantic fans at the front and way more space for airflow. surely there's a slight thermal advantage to getting the Mac Pro, or maybe more sustained performance over a longer time before throttling. and technically, yes, I found that to be slightly True by only like a single digit percentage in most cases and often by a rounding error. but I did do the cinebench 10 minute stress test back to back three times each on the Mac Pro and the Mac Studio, and while the Mac Studio dropped a tiny bit on the second run and the Mac Pro technically increased slightly with each run, suggesting it wasn't near its limit yet it wasn't really that dramatic, like I've seen some people get maybe closer to eight to ten percent out of their tests. but it's not enough to spend three thousand more dollars for more performance out of this machine, put it that way. but another thing is there is more i o on the Mac Pro technically. I mean, it doesn't have the SD card slot on the front, unfortunately, which is one of the most important ones, but it does have a new card at the top here, with six Thunderbolt ports and two more at the front, so totaling eight, which is two more than the Mac Studio. and it also has has two HDMI 2.1 ports instead of one and two ethernet ports instead of one. so technically true, yes, but also you wouldn't spend three thousand dollars more on the Mac Pro just for that. I think people would get dongles for one extra Port. but no, the real difference, the reason the Mac Pro exists, is PCI slots, like that's. that's really it like. the next time you see a comment or a tweet or something of someone going, why does the Mac Pro even exist when you can get the same computer in a Mac Studio is because this one has PCI slots. that's the real reason. the Mac Pro has six open PCI expansion slots that the Mac Studio does not have. five of them PCI Gen 4, the last one, a compatibility slot. it's kind of funny how empty it looks when you get it. like you open this computer up and the entire thing is just air. the M2 Ultra is just under this cooler at the top. the CPU, GPU, shared memory, the media engine, neural engine, everything is just under there and then there's just an expansive room for all these PCI slots, and these PCI slots aren't even for video cards or gpus at all, actually, because, as we know, the GPU, which has 192 up to 192 gigs of shared memory, is built into the Apple silicon chip. so, really, all we're getting the PCI slots for is expansion slots, the pure dedicated expansion slots that a lot of Pros in certain industries use a lot: sound cards, i o cards, storage cards, networking cards. that's it. so, yeah, it is really specific, and it will sound ridiculous to most people that it literally doesn't support video cards, like you could pull a crazy AMD Radeon card out of the Old Mac Pro right now and put it into this thing and basically nothing would happen. but also, at the same time, most of the buyers of these Mac Pros are, you know, Production Studios, post Houses, music studios, things like that. those people already had desktops with PCI slots and they literally could not make a Mac work unless they made one with PCI slots. so that's who Mac Pro is for. it really is too bad, though, that, technically, this Mac Pro will be less versatile than the old one, because there are people who would want to throw powerful GPU cores at certain applications, whether it's after effects or some 3D modeling stuff or Premiere. even that just can't do that with this one. it also doesn't work with, or apparently even need, the old After Burner carts. so I don't know if you remember the afterburner cards and the old Mac Pro were basically these dedicated cars, a two thousand dollar video accelerator card, uh, but apparently the M2 Ultra has enough power that it's the equivalent of like seven afterburner cards. so that, right, there is the real power of Apple silicon if you're shooting prores. but the more I think about it, just so much of this Pro machine stuff is specific to workflows and it's it's very difficult to build one computer with no expansion or upgrade ability or modularity at all that works with everyone's workflows. so there did need to exist a Mac that could accommodate some more interesting workflows. but like I don't shoot prores, I shoot r3d, so I'm not going to need the exact machine that's built super well for Pro. for me it's actually storage. uh, right here I'm holding owc's 8m2 PCI SSD. this is basically a PCI expansion card with a bunch of nvme ssds on it. so the max storage you can get built into the Mac Pro is eight terabytes and it's pretty fast. it's six, seven thousand megabytes per second. read, write, cool, uh. but you can max out one of these cards at 64 terabytes and it will read right at 25 000 megabytes per second, which is absurd, uh. so that's a totally different level. this is what I'm going to dump footage on. this is what I'm going to back up to. this is going to replace my current external Thunderbolt backup, which is where I was keeping all my old footage. it was sitting next to the Mac Studio, plugged in, and I'll still have plenty of room left over to work on and edit multiple video projects off of it at the same time. it's going to be awesome for what I do and I only need one. but also, I fully acknowledge, and you should all realize, that most people don't need those specialized ssds. that's why it looks crazy that this Mac Pro exists just on the website, next to all the rest of the Macs. but most people should get this one. Mac Studio is kind of a revelation for Apple. it's offering their top of the lineup performance for way less than the old top of the lineup, and that's why most people should end up getting that one. I do have one last thing, though. I have a theory. if if I know anything about Apple, it's that you can sort of predict the future pretty well based on the past. and this Mac Pro is a pretty classic lazy refresh from Apple, pretty similar to what they've already done. like look at the MacBook Air. when they first went from the last Intel MacBook Air to the first Apple silicon MacBook Air, they reused the exact same design and just moved the new chip on the inside for all the performance gains. then the second generation of it got the redesign. same thing with the MacBook Pro. right, they took the MacBook Pro with the touch bar and just reused the same design- new chip- and then the next Generation got a redesign. so now this Mac Pro has just done the same first half of that transformation. it's the same exact chassis more or less as the Intel Mac Pro, but I can expect the Next Generation now I'm already thinking about the M3 and that's probably kind of unhealthy, but that's that's where my mind goes. that's just my theory. so anyway, now you know why the macro exists. now you know why I'll have one on my desk and I'll also leave you with this. there was no other place to put it in the review. but I did realize that this Mac Pro does something kind of weird when you take the top halfway off when it's still plugged in. the old one didn't do it, so I'm just going to leave you to it. thanks for watching. catch you guys in the next one. peace [Music]."}, {"title": "Google Pixel Fold Review: Maybe Next Year!", "description": "Pixel Fold is pretty sweet and I'm loving it.

"start": 1003.38, "duration": 3.0}], "text": "hey what's up I'm Kim HD here\nyo the pixel fold is a weird phone there\nare so many things about this thing\nthat are unusual so I and many other\npeople have been waiting for a folding\npixel this is something we imagined was\ncoming eventually so it is kind of\nsurreal to actually be holding and have\nbeen using and testing this phone I've\nbeen using it for about a week now and\nboy do I have a lot of thoughts so I\nguess let's just start with the design I\nreally like a lot of the decisions\nthey've made with this foldable which\nreally optimize far towards it being\nthin and passport shaped originally when\nI first got to play with it I was saying\nman this could be the best foldable to\nuse wall closed and I do now stand by\nthat take it's the easiest best foldable\nto use when it's closed but\nunfortunately it does have a much lower\nranking for using it while open so the\nfront screen is 5.8 inches diagonally\nit's got these curved edges you can see\nand it's actually fairly thin bezels all\nthe way around the rails all the way\naround the phone itself and the hinge\nare stainless steel and the whole thing\nis relatively thin it's just bordering\non a little bit thicker than the\nthickest normal phone you can get I\nthink the number is like 12 millimeters\ntotal you can see there's no air gap in\nthe middle so honestly yeah I've spent a\nlot of time using the outside screen\nlike a normal phone and it's just the\nmost reachable usable outside screen of\nany folding phone you unlock it with the\nfingerprint reader on the side which is\nalso the power button and it's pretty\nquick this is a 120 hertz OLED display\nthat gets up to 1550 nits Peak\nbrightness so it's plenty visible\noutside it looks really good to me in\nmost situations I mean I'm impressed\nthis is a premium outside display which\nI mean I guess I should be for eighteen\nhundred dollars but we'll we'll get to\nthe price a little bit later the point\nis though I I've always said the best\nfoldables have to be usable as just a\nregular phone too and this one does\naccomplish that great so then you open\nup the phone and then that's when things\nstart to get a little more weird so you\ncan't exactly open this phone with one\nhand I've definitely tried I kind of try\nthis with every foldable some are easier\nthan others this one's pretty much a\nno-go but once you get it open when\nyou're in there you're greeted with an\ninterior 7.6 inch folding AMOLED display\nalso 120 Hertz and also plenty bright up\nto 1450 nits really nice size it's\nreminiscent of that Oppo Find N2\nfoldable but there are a couple of\nthings to note here's where some of the\nweird starts so first of all the crease\nis pretty average it's definitely not\ndramatically worse than others I've seen\nbut you can for sure see it if you're\nlooking for it and you can kind of feel\nit but because it's through the middle\nof the screen you aren't usually running\nyour finger over it unlike the\nvertically folding phones so it's not\nreally a big deal it's easy to disappear\nto your eyes as you just look at content\nand use it normally but then there was\njust some talk about how it didn't seem\nlike the phone fully unfolds to 180\ndegrees and well I don't know this hinge\nis really firm so you can Fold It Up\nhalfway or any angle you want really\neasily which is awesome but then when\nyou fold it flat visually it looks\npretty flat but when you put it on a\ntable since there's a camera bump it\nbecomes more clear as it's rocking back\nand forth it's maybe like one or two\ndegrees short of flat it's kind of weird\nI mean you can you can force it to get\nto flat or even a little bit past that\nbut it really doesn't feel good to do\nthat anyway then there is the bezel as\nyou've probably seen by now this phone\ndoes have a slightly bigger top and\nbottom bezel than some other folding\nphones it is noticeable at first when\nyou just look at the bezels uh but again\nit's one of those things where you start\nusing the phone and it is easy to forget\nabout you know I think a lot of videos\nare going to hold it up side by side\nnext to the Samsung fold and then it's\nlike oh yeah clearly one of them has a\ndramatically thinner bezel and it is\nreally noticeable but just using a phone\nit looks fine and Google actually says\nthat this was an intentional decision so\nwhat they were saying is they were again\nbiasing so much towards it being thin\nthat for some of the hinge components\nthey move them out and above and below\nthe hinge instead of in that z-axis\nspace so that it could be as thin as it\nis but now you end up with a little bit\nof extra bezel above oven below the\nscreen\nbut it did allow them room to put in a\nreal webcam or selfie camera instead of\na under display one but also I think\nthis is a little bit along the lines of\nGoogle the pixel has never really been\nall about pristine super highly\nengineered like amazing Hardware they've\nsort of flexed their strengths on the\nsoftware side and uh I think there's a\nlittle bit of that here too either way\nyou can check the box of ipx8 water\nresistance which is nice I do really\nlike this satin finish on the back which\ndoes a good job of minimizing\nfingerprints and looks pretty good and\nthe camera bump doesn't go all the way\nto the very edges to meet the rails of\nthe phone that would have been tough\nwith the foldable but I do still think\nthey did a good job of maintaining the\nwhole pixel aesthetic performance is\nweirdly good it's it's really really\ngood it's actually the best of any pixel\nphone even though it's using the same\nchip it's the tensor G2 from the pixel 7\nand 7 Pro but it's yeah it feels\nsmoother and faster and more consistent\nthan the pixel 7 and 7 Pro so you know\nmaybe it could be that 12 gigs of RAM\nthat are in here it also has 256 or 512\ngigs of ufs 3.1 storage but yeah it's\nbeen butter the whole time I am very\nhappy to report now it's still a pixel\nso I have to add the disclaimer that it\nmight not stay this way you know pixels\nhave a history of this accelerated aging\nwhich is even more of a bummer when you\npay this much for a phone but you know I\ncan't report on that until we actually\nget to a year from now so the best I can\ndo is tell you how it's acting now and\nit is acting great the other thing\nthough that I'm kind of actually hoping\nchanges over time is the battery life\nbecause the battery life in the first\nthis week that I've been testing the\nphone has not been great uh usually\nactually I can kind of just throw away\nthe first day or two of me testing this\none because it's you know still setting\nit up still connecting everything and\ngetting it working properly and then I\ncan start looking at the numbers but\nbasically every day since I first got\nthis phone I've kind of had the same\nexperience which is not that great four\nhours of screen on time at the end of my\nday\num\nwhich is not\nnearly as high as some of the flagships\nout there it is a 4 800 milliamp hour\nbattery which is really good for a\nfoldable but not gigantic for a giant\nscreen on the inside so pixels have this\nfeature called adaptive battery and\nsometimes they can get a little bit\nbetter over time depends on your use\ndepends on who you are your mileage may\nvary\num but hey I've gotten I would say this\nis like C plus battery life and the more\nI think about it\nI've been using a lot of the phone wall\nclosed which means it's the smaller\noutside screen and so if I had been\nusing the larger inside screen even more\nit would not have gone better so yeah c\nc plus for battery but I want to talk\nabout the software experience here\nbecause it is a pixel after all and\nthere is one weird thing so this was a\nvery interesting phone to test because\nGoogle had to do a lot of software work\nand I was excited to try all of it you\nknow Google's apps are all these\nbeautiful tablet optimized apps now\nthey're so thoughtfully designed for the\nphone with this size screen they all\nlook normal on the outside screen but on\nthe inside you know Google Drive has\nthis nice slide out sidebar and\nmulti-column view Gmail's New\nmulti-column View is great the weather\napp the new weather app is absolutely\nfantastic Google Calendar is completely\nredesigned like there's just so much\ngood stuff and then the new dock sort of\nties it all together so this dock I\ntalked about on the pixel tablet you\nswipe up slightly from the bottom and\nthe home bar turns into your home screen\ndock so this is the the apps that you\nhave on the bottom of your home screen\nand you can quickly switch between these\napps or launch into multitasking super\neasily so just like the other folding\nphones I feel like I feel like I'm\nmultitasking God when I'm using this\nhuge folding phone open and just just\ntype it away but here is the weird part\nas far as I can remember uh every other\nfoldable phone allows you to set up the\nhome screens and stuff on the outside\nscreen and then the inside screen is\nseparate you can have a separate set of\nwidgets you can go crazy and make a\ndifferent layout on the inside here\nand on this phone\nyou cannot do that so look right now my\noutside screen is these three pages this\none with the icons in the weather and\nthen this calendar widget one and then\nthis third one so when I open up the\nphone that's exactly mirrored here the\nleft one is the first home screen then\nthe right one is the second one and I\nswipe over and here's the third one but\nif I like take this raindrop icon and\nmove it over here and then when I go\nback to closed it's also moved the\nRaindrop icon there because it's keeping\nthem exactly mirrored at all times which\nis fine I think that actually makes a\nlot of sense especially for beginners\nlike I I bet if if Apple made a folding\niPhone right now they would do the exact\nsame thing because iPhone users are used\nto not having a ton of customization on\ntheir home screens but\nI haven't found a way to unlock that at\nall like there's no I haven't seen any\nhome screen setting or display setting\nto actually be able to set up a\ndifferent home screen on the inside\nversus the outside just feels kind of on\nAndroid like to me like I feel like I\ncan't be the only one who's spending\neighteen hundred dollars on a first gen\nfolding phone who would like to have\nsome apps on the outside screen and then\nlike a bunch of widgets on the inside\nscreen you know you actually can't even\nspan the Middle With One widget because\nit's treating them basically as two\nseparate home screens even though it's\nall with one big folding screen I just\nfound that so weird so anyway aside from\nthat I really enjoyed using the pixel\nfold seriously between the great\nperformance and the Google software you\nknow all the pixel stuff Google\nAssistant call screening Etc it's really\neasy to get past the weirdness the other\nthing you typically expect out of a\npixel though is good cameras so let's\ntalk about this camera situation for a\nlittle bit because as I've said\neverywhere you look there's just a\nlittle bit of weird so first of all\nactually there are five cameras on this\nphone there is the nine megapixel hole\npunch camera on the front on the outside\nscreen then there's an eight megapixel\ncamera on the inside up in that bezel\nthen there's the three primary cameras\non the back the thing with these back\ncameras is because of how thin the phone\nis there's definitely not enough room to\nphysically fit the same size sensors and\nOptics that you have in the flagship\npixel phone so there is all new stuff\nhere and it's a little bit smaller so\nthere's a 48 megapixel main camera a 10\nmegapixel Ultra wide and a 10 megapixel\n5x telephoto\npixel fold photos\nfeel a lot like pixel 7A photos which\nisn't an insult that's just to say that\nthey're in the same style you know the\nsame contrasty pixel style but overall\nare definitely a step down in quality\nfrom the flagships they're a bit noisier\na bit more muted in the colors\nespecially with the ultra wide and it\ntakes a bit longer to gather the same\namount of light as the larger Flagship\nsensors also if you want to see video\nfrom the pixel fold I actually shot the\nentire last autofocus video on the pixel\nfold so you can clearly see it's a step\ndown from some of the other flagships\nI've shot with there's a lot of noise\nand the darker areas of the frame\nbut I will say it was definitely easier\nto shoot with because it's a folding\nphone so I can just unfold it and I see\nthe viewfinder and I can frame things up\nwith the primary camera so that's an\nadvantage but yeah it's not like you're\ngonna go out and shoot you know movies\non this thing I mean Samsung has had to\ndeal with the same type of thing like\nthe the camera quality of their super\nexpensive foldable phones has always\nbeen a slight step down from their you\nknow big Flagship slab style phones so I\nthink that's a fair comparison this is\nuh a step it's a notch down from the\npixel Flagship cameras you know what's\nfun\nthis is a this is technically a first\ngen device right this is the first time\nGoogle's ever made a foldable\nand on one hand you can kind of tell\nthat they've at least learned some\nthings from the other foldables already\nout there because this feels a little\nbit better in some ways like they've\ngone with this passport sized form\nfactor and they've made conscious\ndecisions to make it thin and there's\nsome hinge Innovation here and it's kept\nthe pixel aesthetic just a lot of good\nchoices that are impressive for a first\ngen device but it's still clearly has\nsome first gen shortcomings also that\nhave me thinking well maybe the next one\nwill be better you know like for the\ninside display the crease and the bezels\nand the 178 degree almost flat fold like\nmaybe the next one will be better for\nthe weak battery life like yes there is\nwireless charging but hey maybe the next\none will have faster charging than the\ncurrent Max of 30 watts and of course\nthe app situation is still let's just\nsay it's clearly imperfect so they've\ndone a lot of good stuff with their\nsoftware but some apps still look\nhorrible I mean look at Instagram it\njust it looks terrible you can double\ntap to the left or to the right to move\nit over closer to the side where it's\nmore reachable but still I mean that\nthat is rough Twitter also looks\nhorrible my golf app 18 birdies also not\noptimized even YouTube studio is just\nnot optimized for this bigger screen and\nthe list goes on and on and on maybe\nmaybe that'll be better by the next one\nso then the last weird thing about this\nphone is it is one thousand eight\nhundred dollars so of course that that\nprices out pretty much anyone who's just\ngonna like walk into a store casually\nand just get a normal upgrade for their\nphone it will be relegated to the early\nadopters the enthusiasts maybe people\nwatching this video uh and the pixel\nfans it's a smaller group but also I\ngotta say weirdly enough\nI really like using this phone I like\nlove using this phone it's got just the\nright set of quirks and features to that\nthat I like it over the regular pixel\nwhich I had been using\nand also I think it's it's specifically\nbecause it's so well optimized for using\nit closed like I keep talking about how\nit's the best foldable to use closed\nit's got the right set of strengths and\nweaknesses that I spend most of my time\njust enjoying using it like a normal\nphone close and then every once in a\nwhile my 20 30 40 of the time that I\nopen it up and use it it's just this\nwhole new world and it's a nice benefit\nit's getting closer to that ideal\nfolding phone for me\nI really like it it's also Android 14\ncoming up soon\nuh five years of Promise security\nupdates\ngreat haptics great speakers I mean this\nthere's a lot of it's got just enough\nupside that I really like it I'm sure\nI'm looking forward to the next one\nstill of course but for anyone else\nwho's going to jump in on this first gen\nversion just know what you're getting\ninto it's a weird one\nbut I like it also you might have\nspotted a few designs from Channel\nsponsor dbrand a few times in this video\nthis new one is called Robot City and I\nthink it's pretty sick it's one of my\nfavorite designs they've released yet uh\nit helps a lot also on a phone that says\nmonotonous as the pixel fold so these\nsort of designs have kind of become a\nstaple of dbrand over the years I don't\nknow if you remember the the hair dryer\nthat's been in the studio which was\nwrapped in the original robot Skin So\nthis new one Robot City if you can look\nclosely you'll see it actually there are\nthree different versions that you can\nchoose from there were all these unique\ndiscreet pieces of art first one is\ncalled Dead quarters kind of like a\ndystopian headquarters of Robot City the\nsecond one is amusement park complete\nwith sharks and Krakens and doomed\ncarnival rides and the third one really\nhits home for me it's called crime\nSquare\nbecause you know like Times Square but\nwith crime there are so many Easter eggs\nin them it's silly uh so if you want to\ncheck them out the Robot City skins are\navailable on over 100 devices including\nthe pixel folds if you want to check\nthem out I'll have a link Down Below in\nthe description either way that's been\nit\ntill the next one thanks for watching\ncatch you later\npeace\nforeign\n", "punctuated_text": "hey, what's up, I'm Kim HD here. yo, the pixel fold is a weird phone. there are so many things about this thing that are unusual, so I and many other people have been waiting for a folding pixel. this is something we imagined was coming eventually. so it is kind of surreal to actually be holding and have been using and testing this phone. I've been using it for about a week now and boy do I have a lot of thoughts. so I guess let's just start with the design. I really like a lot of the decisions they've made with this foldable, which really optimize far towards it being thin and passport shaped. originally, when I first got to play with it I was saying, man, this could be the best foldable to use wall closed, and I do now stand by that take. it's the easiest best foldable to use when it's closed, but unfortunately it does have a much lower ranking for using it while open. so the front screen is 5.8 inches diagonally. it's got these curved edges you can see, and it's actually fairly thin. bezels all the way around the rails, all the way around the phone itself and the hinge are stainless steel and the whole thing is relatively thin. it's just bordering on a little bit thicker than the thickest normal phone you can get. I think the number is like 12 millimeters total. you can see there's no air gap in the middle. so, honestly, yeah, I've spent a lot of time using the outside screen like a normal phone, and it's just the most reachable, usable outside screen of any folding phone. you unlock it with the fingerprint reader on the side, which is also the power button, and it's pretty quick. this is a 120 hertz OLED display that gets up to 1550 nits Peak brightness, so it's plenty visible outside. it looks really good to me in most situations. I mean I'm impressed. this is a premium outside display, which I mean I guess I should be for eighteen hundred dollars, but we'll, we'll get to the price a little bit later. the point is, though, I I've always said the best foldables have to be usable as just a regular phone too, and this one does accomplish that great. so then you open up the phone, and then that's when things start to get a little more weird, so you can't exactly open this phone with one hand. I've definitely tried. I kind of try this with every foldable. some are easier than others. this one's pretty much a no-go, but once you get it open. when you're in there you're greeted with an interior 7.6 inch folding AMOLED display, also 120 Hertz, and also plenty bright, up to 1450 nits- really nice size. it's reminiscent of that Oppo Find N2- foldable. but there are a couple of things to note. here's where some of the weird starts. so first of all, the crease is pretty average. it's definitely not dramatically worse than others I've seen, but you can for sure see it if you're looking for it and you can kind of feel it. but because it's through the middle of the screen you aren't usually running your finger over it, unlike the vertically folding phones, so it's not really a big deal. it's easy to disappear to your eyes as you just look at content and use it normally. but then there was just some talk about how it didn't seem like the phone fully unfolds to 180 degrees and well, I don't know. this hinge is really firm so you can Fold It Up halfway or any angle you want really easily, which is awesome. but then when you fold it flat, visually it looks pretty flat, but when you put it on a table- since there's a camera bump, it becomes more clear as it's rocking back and forth. it's maybe like one or two degrees short of flat. it's kind of weird. I mean, you can, you can force it to get to flat or even a little bit past that, but it really doesn't feel good to do that anyway. then there is the bezel. as you've probably seen by now, this phone does have a slightly bigger top and bottom bezel than some other folding phones. it is noticeable at first when you just look at the bezels, uh, but again, it's one of those things where you start using the phone and it is easy to forget about. you know, I think a lot of videos are going to hold it up side by side next to the Samsung fold- and then it's like: oh yeah, clearly one of them has a dramatically thinner bezel and it is really noticeable. but just using a phone it looks fine. and Google actually says that this was an intentional decision. so what they were saying is they were again biasing so much towards it being thin that for some of the hinge components they move them out and above and below the hinge instead of in that z-axis space, so that it could be as thin as it is. but now you end up with a little bit of extra bezel above oven, below the screen, but it did allow them room to put in a real webcam or selfie camera instead of a under display one. but also, I think this is a little bit along the lines of Google. the pixel has never really been all about pristine, super highly engineered like amazing Hardware. they've sort of flexed their strengths on the software side and, uh, I think there's a little bit of that here too. either way, you can check the box of ipx8 water resistance, which is nice. I do really like this satin finish on the back, which does a good job of minimizing fingerprints and looks pretty good, and the camera bump doesn't go all the way to the very edges to meet the rails of the phone. that would have been tough with the foldable, but I do still think they did a good job of maintaining the whole pixel aesthetic performance is weirdly good. it's. it's really really good. it's actually the best of any pixel phone, even though it's using the same chip- it's the tensor G2 from the pixel 7 and 7 Pro, but it's, yeah, it feels smoother and faster and more consistent than the pixel 7 and 7 Pro. so, you know, maybe it could be that 12 gigs of RAM that are in here. it also has 256 or 512 gigs of ufs 3.1 storage, but yeah, it's been butter the whole time. I am very happy to report. now it's still a pixel, so I have to add the disclaimer that it might not stay this way. you know, pixels have a history of this accelerated aging, which is even more of a bummer when you pay this much for a phone. but you know I can't report on that until we actually get to a year from now. so the best I can do is tell you how it's acting now, and it is acting great. the other thing, though, that I'm kind of actually hoping changes over time is the battery life, because the battery life in the first this week that I've been testing the phone has not been great. uh, usually, actually, I can kind of just throw away the first day or two of me testing this one because it's, you know, still setting it up, still connecting everything and getting it working properly, and then I can start looking at the numbers. but basically every day since I first got this phone I've kind of had the same experience, which is not that great: four hours of screen on time at the end of my day, um, which is not nearly as high as some of the flagships out there it is a 4 800 milliamp hour battery, which is really good for a foldable but not gigantic for a giant screen on the inside. so pixels have this feature called adaptive battery and sometimes they can get a little bit better over time. depends on your use, depends on who you are. your mileage may vary, um, but hey, I've gotten. I would say this is like C plus battery life, and the more I think about it, I've been using a lot of the phone wall closed, which means it's the smaller outside screen, and so if I had been using the larger inside screen even more, it would not have gone better. so, yeah, c, c plus for battery. but I want to talk about the software experience here, because it is a pixel after all and there is one weird thing. so this was a very interesting phone to test because Google had to do a lot of software work and I was excited to try all of it. you know Google's apps are all these beautiful tablet optimized apps. now they're so thoughtfully designed for the phone with this size screen. they all look normal on the outside screen but on the inside, you know, Google Drive has this nice slide out sidebar and multi-column view. Gmail's New multi-column View is great. the weather app- the new weather app- is absolutely fantastic. Google Calendar is completely redesigned, like there's just so much good stuff. and then the new dock sort of ties it all together. so this dock I talked about on the pixel tablet- you swipe up slightly from the bottom and the home bar turns into your home screen dock. so this is the- the apps that you have on the bottom of your home screen, and you can quickly switch between these apps or launch into multitasking super easily. so, just like the other folding phones, I feel like I feel like I'm multitasking, God, when I'm using this huge folding phone open and just just type it away. but here is the weird part: as far as I can remember, uh, every other foldable phone allows you to set up the home screens and stuff on the outside screen and then the inside screen is separate. you can have a separate set of widgets. you can go crazy and make a different layout on the inside. here and on this phone you cannot do that. so look, right now my outside screen is these three pages: this one with the icons in the weather and then this calendar widget one and then this third one. so when I open up the phone that's exactly mirrored here. the left one is the first home screen, then the right one is the second one and I swipe over and here's the third one. but if I like, take this raindrop icon and move it over here and then when I go back to closed, it's also moved the Raindrop icon there, because it's keeping them exactly mirrored at all times, which is fine. I think that actually makes a lot of sense, especially for beginners like I. I bet if, if Apple made a folding iPhone right now, they would do the exact same thing, because iPhone users are used to not having a ton of customization on their home screens. but I haven't found a way to unlock that at all. like there's- no, I haven't seen any home screen setting or display setting. to actually be able to set up a different home screen on the inside versus the outside just feels kind of on Android like to me. like I feel like I can't be the only one who's spending eighteen hundred dollars on a first gen folding phone who would like to have some apps on the outside screen and then like a bunch of widgets on the inside screen. you know you actually can't even span the Middle With One widget because it's treating them basically as two separate home screens, even though it's all with one big folding screen. I just found that so weird. so, anyway, aside from that, I really enjoyed using the pixel fold. seriously, between the great performance and the Google software- you know all the pixel stuff- Google Assistant, call screening, Etc. it's really easy to get past the weirdness. the other thing you typically expect out of a pixel, though, is good cameras, so let's talk about this camera situation for a little bit, because, as I've said, everywhere you look there's just a little bit of weird. so, first of all, actually, there are five cameras on this phone. there is the nine megapixel hole punch camera on the front, on the outside screen. then there's an eight megapixel camera on the inside, up in that bezel. then there's the three primary cameras on the back. the thing with these back cameras is, because of how thin the phone is, there's definitely not enough room to physically fit the same size sensors and Optics that you have in the flagship pixel phone. so there is all new stuff here, and it's a little bit smaller. so there's a 48 megapixel main camera, a 10 megapixel Ultra wide and a 10 megapixel 5x telephoto. pixel fold photos feel a lot like pixel 7A photos, which isn't an insult. that's just to say that they're in the same style- you know the same contrasty pixel style- but overall are definitely a step down in quality from the flagships. they're a bit noisier, a bit more muted in the colors, especially with the ultra wide, and it takes a bit longer to gather the same amount of light as the larger Flagship sensors. also, if you want to see video from the pixel fold, I actually shot the entire last autofocus video on the pixel fold so you can clearly see it's a step down from some of the other flagships I've shot with. there's a lot of noise and the darker areas of the frame. but I will say it was definitely easier to shoot with because it's a folding phone so I can just unfold it and I see the viewfinder and I can frame things up with the primary camera. so that's an advantage. but yeah, it's not like you're gonna go out and shoot. you know movies on this thing. I mean, Samsung has had to deal with the same type of thing like the. the camera quality of their super expensive foldable phones has always been a slight step down from their- you know, big Flagship slab style phones. so I think that's a fair comparison. this is, uh, a step, it's a notch down from the pixel Flagship cameras. you know what's fun? this is a. this is technically a first gen device, right? this is the first time Google's ever made a foldable and on one hand, you can kind of tell that they've at least learned some things from the other foldables already out there, because this feels a little bit better in some ways, like they've gone with this passport sized form factor and they've made conscious decisions to make it thin. and there's some hinge Innovation here and it's kept the pixel aesthetic. just a lot of good choices that are impressive for a first gen device. but it's still clearly has some first gen shortcomings also that have me thinking: well, maybe the next one will be better, you know, like for the inside display, the crease and the bezels and the 178 degree almost flat fold. like maybe the next one will be better for the weak battery life. like, yes, there is wireless charging, but hey, maybe the next one will have faster charging than the current Max of 30 watts. and of course, the app situation is still- let's just say it's- clearly imperfect. so they've done a lot of good stuff with their software, but some apps still look horrible. I mean, look at Instagram. it just it looks terrible. you can double tap to the left or to the right to move it over closer to the side where it's more reachable, but still I mean that that is rough. Twitter also looks horrible. my golf app, 18 birdies also not optimized. even YouTube studio is just not optimized for this bigger screen, and the list goes on and on and on. maybe, maybe that'll be better by the next one. so then, the last weird thing about this phone is it is one thousand eight hundred dollars, so of course, that that prices out pretty much anyone who's just gonna like walk into a store casually and just get a normal upgrade for their phone. it will be relegated to the early adopters, the enthusiasts, maybe people watching this video, uh, and the pixel fans. it's a smaller group, but also I gotta say, weirdly enough, I really like using this phone. I like love using this phone. it's got just the right set of quirks and features to that that I like it over the regular pixel which I had been using, and also I think it's it's specifically because it's so well optimized for using it closed, like I keep talking about how it's the best foldable to use closed. it's got the right set of strengths and weaknesses that I spend most of my time just enjoying using it like a normal phone- close, and then, every once in a while, my 20, 30, 40 of the time that I open it up and use it. it's just this whole new world and it's a nice benefit. it's getting closer to that ideal folding phone for me. I really like it. it's also Android 14 coming up soon. uh, five years of Promise, security updates, great haptics, great speakers- I mean this. there's a lot of. it's got just enough upside that I really like it. I'm sure I'm looking forward to the next one, still, of course, but for anyone else who's going to jump in on this first gen version, just know what you're getting into. it's a weird one, but I like it also. you might have spotted a few designs from Channel sponsor dbrand a few times in this video. this new one is called Robot City and I think it's pretty sick. it's one of my favorite designs they've released yet. uh, it helps a lot, also on a phone that says monotonous as the pixel fold. so these sort of designs have kind of become a staple of dbrand over the years. I don't know if you remember the, the hair dryer that's been in the studio, which was wrapped in the original robot Skin. So this new one, Robot City, if you can look closely you'll see it. actually there are three different versions that you can choose from. there were all these unique, discreet pieces of art. first one is called Dead quarters, kind of like a dystopian headquarters of Robot City. the second one is amusement park, complete with sharks and Krakens and doomed carnival rides. and the third one really hits home for me. it's called crime Square because, you know, like Times Square, but with crime. there are so many Easter eggs in them, it's silly, uh. so if you want to check them out, the Robot City skins are available on over 100 devices, including the pixel folds. if you want to check them out, I'll have a link Down Below in the description. either way, that's been it till the next one. thanks

really old here\njust for a second but about 10 years ago\nthere was a vibrant ecosystem of a ton\nof different tablets there's all kinds\nof tablets there is like iPads versus\nAndroid tablets all these fights going\non there were small screen tablets big\nscreen tablets and all the Android\ntablets were sort of anchored by\nGoogle's family of Nexus tablets so we\nhad the Smash Hit Nexus 7 and the cult\nclassic Nexus 10 but then Google kind of\ngot a little bit lost with Android\ntablets and Chrome OS tablets a little\nbit in there for a bit and they made a\nfew bad ones in a row and then they just\ngave up\nlike they literally just gave up stopped\nmaking tablets but something else that's\npicked up a whole bunch of steam since\nthen is a new product category Smart\nHome displays so Google bought nest and\nwe've seen this Nest Hub and the nest\nHub Max came out and this is a growing\ncategory every single month so at some\npoint during all of this Google probably\nthought wait a second we're making all\nthese Smart Home displays and what is a\nsmart home display it's basically just a\ncheap tablet\nso what if we just made a cheap tablet\nthat could turn into a smart home\ndisplay\nand so that's how we got this this is\nthe pixel tablet so I've been using this\ntablet for a few weeks now and look it's\nnot amazing or super premium or high-end\nor exciting uh and neither are any of\nthe other Smart Home displays but I do\nwant to talk about it it's also a little\nbit interesting and underrated and how\nimportant this tablet could be to other\ntablets so let's talk about it so as a\ntablet this thing is pretty simple I\nreally like the soft touch finish on the\nback this is the porcelain color and it\nhides fingerprints really really well\nfeels solid in the hand it's actually\nmade of metal but you honestly could\nnever tell just holding it thanks to\nthis coating but it's very basic single\ncamera on the back corner volume buttons\nwith the inset fingerprint reader that\ndoubles as a power button up at the top\nthere's a set of speakers on the left\nand right that sounds okay but really\ndoesn't have much bass at all and the\nUSBC Port is on the left hand side it's\nnot too big it's not too heavy and on\nthe front is an 11 inch 2560 by 1600\n60hz LCD display with bezels just thin\nenough to hold it and not be a problem\nand the display does not get\nparticularly bright and it's not the\nfastest thing in the world but it is\nrunning the same tensor G2 chip as the\npixel 7s but I just I I cannot call this\ntablet fast not sure if it's under\nclocked or what's happening here but it\nbehaves very much like a basic mid-range\nAndroid tablet and that's because that's\nbasically what it is this is a 499\ndollar tablet and it comes with the dock\nin the box that you can buy separately\nif you want to if you want an additional\none for 130 so I would say\ntame your expectations here like it's it\nworks and it's it does what it's\nsupposed to but I would just I would say\ntame your expectations so this speaker\ndock comes on the box which I think is\nsuper cool and it's actually the only\nway to charge the tablet that comes in\nthe box there is no USBC Cable in here\nit's just the dock which has a barrel\nconnector that connects to the wall and\nthe dock is basically it's just a\nspeaker in a box really with some pins\nsuper simple the pins kind of retract a\nlittle bit when you touch them which is\ncool but basically the premise is\nthere's some magnets in the dock as you\ncan see here with this magnet paper and\nthere's some magnets in the tablet which\nyou can also see here with this magnet\npaper and so when you line those up and\nconnect the dock to the tablet it just\npops right onto those pins and the pins\ncarry both power and data so now it's\ncharging and the audio quality should be\nimproved because it's now using the\nspeaker in the dock it works pretty darn\nquickly too thankfully it's not\nBluetooth pairing or anything it's just\nliterally a physical connection for the\nthe data so it's just like connecting\nlike an iPad to a keyboard it just works\nright away it holds it at a pretty good\nangle too it's basically straight up and\ndown it looks just like a nest home hub\nwhen you put it on the dock like that\nmagnets are pretty strong you can pop it\noff with one hand if you want to\nI'm just uh I'm just glad that this\ncomes in the box and isn't an additional\nhundred thirty dollars first of all the\ncharging speed is up to 15 watts which\nis\nnot that fast it's a tablet battery so\nit's pretty big takes a while to charge\num and then the the speaker in here is\nnot that great I would say it feels on\npar with like the nest Hub Mini at Best\nso the speakers in the tablet are uh\nlike I said they're fine but they really\nlack a lot of bass and then when you add\nit to the speaker dock you're getting\nlike 20 to 30 more volume but it's\nmostly just adding the bass back but\nit's not super loud here I'll give you\na little sample\nnot a ton of bass right\n[Music]\nall low end\nand it's quick too it's immediate as\nsoon as I pop it off back to the\nspeakers but it's not the it's not the\nloudest thing in the world honestly it's\nI guess it's fine this dock cannot be\nused as a Bluetooth speaker or anything\nelse when a tablet isn't attached but\nhonestly I don't think you'd want to\nit's basically just sits there and is\nwaiting for the tablet to be attached to\nit what's funny though is it does help\nwith the battery so the battery life on\nthis tablet was decent for me but it did\nhave particularly weak standby life for\nsome reason it would drop like 10\novernight sometimes which could be a bug\neither way the idea is when you're done\nusing it you can pop it onto the dock\nand it is literally just a smart speaker\nnow if you really wanted to you could\nbuy another one and put it in a\ndifferent room and then when it's in the\nkitchen per se it'll show you certain\nthings when it's in the bedroom it'll\nshow you other things but it is a\nhundred and thirty dollars per Dock and\nI'm now starting to think that that's\nthe more overpriced thing among this\nbundle so just know what you're getting\ninto that but I think really what I\nrealized is this docking feature is cool\nbut it's not the most interesting part\nof this tablet for me it's the\nheadlining feature because it's the cool\nthing that it does but as I was talking\nabout there was this whole tablet\necosystem like 10 years ago and seeing\nwhat Google does with the software for\nthis tablet could give us a window into\nhow Google can anchor Android tablets\nagain going forward so I was really\ncurious about the software so here's\nwhat I found number one I really like\nthe new dock the software dock so the\nhome button at the bottom you can swipe\nup at any time and all the same gestures\nwork like normal but there's a new\ngesture where you just grab the Bottom\nbar and swipe up just a little bit and\nthat brings up a dock which is the exact\nsame order of whatever apps you had in\nyour home screen dock it also shows up\nin multitasking and then from there you\ncan switch to a recent app or initiate\nmultitasking by dragging something to\nhalf the screen to get two things going\nat once it works great it simple I use\nit all the time for going back and forth\nbetween two things quickly so I really\nlike that then number two multi-user\nsupport is so sick and the iPad should\nseriously be taking notes on this so\nanytime you want either from the\nnotification tray or from the lock\nscreen or anywhere that you see that\nprofile picture for your account you can\nswitch users when you set up a new user\nat first you basically go through the\nwhole setup process as if you're setting\nup a brand new tablet and then that\nsecond person can sign into their apps\nand set up their home screen and their\nwidgets and everything and you can\nswitch back and forth by logging into\neach one literally just with your\nfingerprint it's exactly as simple as it\nshould be it could also totally be like\none person's personal profile and\nbusiness profile so you never get the\ntwo confused or I don't know just a\nprofile for your burner accounts\nwhatever you want to make it the point\nis tablets are often used at home and by\nfamilies that have more than one person\nso the ability to just like log into\nyour kids account and not have them\nworry about accidentally buying thirty\nthousand dollars of I don't know\nMinecraft credits or something it's a\npretty obviously great feature and then\nnumber three of course Hub mode this is\nthe mode that sort of pops up when you\nget it onto the dock uh that they had to\nbuild of course because they turned this\ninto a Smart Hub I kind of end up just\nusing it like a Smart Hub a lot of the\ntime that it's on this dock I don't\ntouch it as much I just use voice\ncontrols which all work and then I have\na clock here you can do like a photo\ngallery type thing or rotating pieces of\nArt and of course the smart home display\ncontrols are available at the bottom\ncorner but it just kind of lives like\nthat I have it in the kitchen most of\nthe time\nnice oh this is also fun fact the the\nfirst tablet that has Chromecast built\nin as a Target so you can use it as a\nTarget to Chromecast things to it\nI would never do that but you can do\nthat so the number four last but not\nleast is the app situation this is\nsomething we talk a lot about with\nAndroid tablets and there was a lot of\npromise with this version and with this\ntablet that there would be a whole bunch\nof new tablet optimized apps and that\nthat experience would be meaningfully\ndifferent\nand it's not well I guess you could say\nit's a little bit true so Google can say\nthat their own apps are now all\noptimized and take full advantage of the\nlarger display so you know you can be\nconfident anytime you open a Google app\non this Google tablet it's going to look\ngreat and that's awesome but for all of\nthe rest of the apps that make the world\ngo round all the third-party apps all\nthe stuff that you probably are thinking\nabout when getting a tablet that you're\ngoing to use there is no meaningful\ndifference in that situation right now\nso a lot of them are still uh\nbig phone apps I would say Instagram is\nstill a giant phone app Twitter is still\na giant phone app Tesla is still a giant\nphone app Expedia stole a giant phone\napp cash app is still not optimized\nneither is Tick Tock it still kind of\nlooks weird SoundCloud is like half\noptimized I guess Pocket Casts is also\nhalfway there looking like a giant phone\napp overdrop weather is still a blown up\nphone app and the list goes on and on\nthey have this thing where you can uh\ndouble tap the space to the left or to\nthe right to move it over to the side to\nmake it more one-handable but I mean\nyeah that's it it's just a big phone app\nthe app ecosystem for Android tablets is\nstill to this day even now that this has\narrived it's still the biggest weakness\nof an Android tablet and the incentive\nit's got to be on developers of course\nbut most of their incentive is to be as\nsimple and streamlined as possible and\nif you can just make one iPad app that\ncovers all iPads you'll do it but if you\ncan make one tablet app\nit won't necessarily work on all Android\ntablets so the incentive is still kind\nof tough well actually there is one app\nthat Google can say that they got\noptimized before the iPad and that's the\ncalculator\nthey did do a full scientific not\nscientific but a full-on calculator\nthere's a history over here to the side\nthere's the readout which you can change\nthe size of a light and dark theme all\nthis stuff it's\npretty good\nyour move Apple some other little random\nthings that didn't quite fit into the\nfull review uh when it's docked on the\ncharger it default charges up to 90 not\n100 but I do think that's smart IT\npreserves the battery life overall\nthere's also no headphone jack on this\ntablet just so you know and then in case\nyou're wondering the camera quality is\nvery much in line with the rest of this\ntablet's Hardware pretty mid it's good\nenough for basic video calls and\ndocument scanning but nobody's shooting\nany movies on this thing at the end of\nthe day though my conclusion is this\ntwo in one devices are typically they're\nfunny because they're they're always\nlike slightly worse at one of the things\nthat they're trying to be this is a two\nin one device it's a tablet and it's a\nsmart home hub so I was wondering as I\ngot it like what is it going to be\ncompromised at is it worse at one or\nworse at the other turns out it's a\ndecent cheap Android tablet\nand it's a slightly below average\nspeaker dock home hub\nuh but that's fine I think those two\nthings are close enough together and are\nsimple enough that it makes sense at\nleast I would personally love a super\nhigh-end version of this I'd be so down\nfor like a 120 hertz super fast nice\npremium tablet that also could dock\nwhenever I want on a nice speaker and\nbecome like this high-end like Boombox\nthing but I also know that that would be\nsuper expensive and would have a much\nmuch smaller Target demographic and\nprobably wouldn't sell enough to exist\nwell so\nthis is the thing that makes sense and I\nthink it may actually sell a decent\namount and we'll see how it does until\nthe next one thanks for watching\ncatch in the next one peace\nforeign\n[Music]\n", "punctuated_text": "thank you, hey, what's up? I'm Kim BFC here. okay, I'm gonna make myself sound really old here just for a second. but about 10 years ago there was a vibrant ecosystem of a ton of different tablets. there's all kinds of tablets. there is like iPads versus Android tablets, all these fights going on. there were small screen tablets, big screen tablets and all the Android tablets were sort of anchored by Google's family of Nexus tablets. so we had the Smash Hit Nexus 7 and the cult classic Nexus 10. but then Google kind of got a little bit lost with Android tablets and Chrome OS tablets a little bit in there for a bit and they made a few bad ones in a row and then they just gave up- like they literally just gave up, stopped making tablets. but something else that's picked up a whole bunch of steam since then is a new product category: Smart Home displays. so Google bought nest and we've seen this Nest Hub and the nest Hub Max came out, and this is a growing category every single month. so at some point during all of this, Google probably thought: wait a second, we're making all these Smart Home displays, and what is a smart home display? it's basically just a cheap tablet. so what if we just made a cheap tablet, that could turn into a smart home display, and so that's how we got this. this is the pixel tablet. so I've been using this tablet for a few weeks now and look, it's not amazing or super premium or high-end or exciting, uh, and neither are any of the other Smart Home displays, but I do want to talk about it. it's also a little bit interesting and underrated and how important this tablet could be to other tablets, so let's talk about it. so, as a tablet, this thing is pretty simple.

I'm just- uh, I'm just glad that this comes in the box and isn't an additional hundred thirty dollars. first of all, the charging speed is up to 15 watts, which is not that fast. it's a tablet battery, so it's pretty big. takes a while to charge, um, and then the. the speaker in here is not that great. I would say it feels on par with like the nest Hub Mini at Best. so the speakers in the tablet are, uh, like I said, they're fine, but they really lack a lot of bass. and then when you add it to the speaker dock, you're getting like 20 to 30 more volume, but it's mostly just adding the bass back, but it's not super loud here. I'll give you a little sample. not a ton of bass, right, [Music], all low end, and it's quick too. it's immediate as soon as I pop it off back to the speakers, but it's not the. it's not the loudest thing in the world. honestly it's. I guess it's fine. this dock cannot be used as a Bluetooth speaker or anything else when a tablet isn't attached, but honestly, I don't think you'd want to. it's basically just sits there and is waiting for the tablet to be attached to it. what's funny, though, is it does help with the battery. so the battery life on this tablet was decent for me, but it did have particularly weak standby life. for some reason it would drop like 10 overnight sometimes, which could be a bug. either way, the idea is, when you're done using it, you can pop it onto the dock and it is literally just a smart speaker. now, if you really wanted to, you could buy another one and put it in a different room and then, when it's in the kitchen, per se, it'll show you certain things. when it's in the bedroom, it'll show you other things. but it is a hundred and thirty dollars per Dock and I'm now starting to think that that's the more overpriced thing among this bundle. so just know what you're getting into that. but I think really what I realized is this docking feature is cool, but it's not the most interesting part of this tablet. for me it's the headlining feature, because it's the cool thing that it does. but, as I was talking about, there was this whole tablet ecosystem like 10 years ago, and seeing what Google does with the software for this tablet could give us a window into how Google can anchor Android tablets again going forward. so I was really curious about the software. so here's what I found. number one: I really like the new dock, the software dock. so the home button at the bottom you can swipe up at any time and all the same gestures work like normal. but there's a new gesture where you just grab the Bottom bar and swipe up just a little bit and that brings up a dock which is the exact same order of whatever apps you had in your home screen dock. it also shows up in multitasking and then from there you can switch to a recent app or initiate multitasking by dragging something to half the screen to get two things going at once. it works great. it simple. I use it all the time for going back and forth between two things quickly, so I really like that. then number two: multi-user support is so sick and the iPad should seriously be taking notes on this. so anytime you want- either from the notification tray or from the lock screen or anywhere that you see that profile picture for your account- you can switch users. when you set up a new user at first, you basically go through the whole setup process as if you're setting up a brand new tablet, and then that second person can sign into their apps and set up their home screen and their widgets and everything, and you can switch back and forth by logging into each one literally just with your fingerprint. it's exactly as simple as it should be. it could also totally be like one person's personal profile and business profile, so you never get the two confused, or I don't know, just a profile for your burner accounts. whatever you want to make it, the point is, tablets are often used at home and by families that have more than one person, so the ability to just like log into your kids account and not have them worry about accidentally buying thirty thousand dollars of I don't know Minecraft credits or something, it's a pretty obviously great feature. and then, number three, of course, Hub mode. this is the mode that sort of pops up when you get it onto the dock. uh, that they had to build, of course, because they turned this into a Smart Hub. I kind of end up just using it like a Smart Hub a lot of the time that it's on this dock. I don't touch it as much. I just use voice controls, which all work. and then I have a clock here you can do like a photo gallery type thing or rotating pieces of Art. and, of course, the smart home display controls are available at the bottom corner, but it just kind of lives like that. I have it in the kitchen most of the time. nice, oh, this is also fun fact- the the first tablet that has Chromecast built in as a Target, so you can use it as a Target to Chromecast things to it. I would never do that, but you can do that. so the number four, last but not least, is the app situation. this is something we talk a lot about with Android tablets and there was a lot of promise with this version and with this tablet that there would be a whole bunch of new tablet optimized apps and that that experience would be meaningfully different. and it's not well. I guess you could say it's a little bit true. so Google can say that their own apps are now all optimized and take full advantage of the larger display. so you know, you can be confident anytime you open a Google app on this Google tablet, it's going to look great and that's awesome. but for all of the rest of the apps that make the world go round, all the third-party apps, all the stuff that you probably are thinking about when getting a tablet that you're going to use- there is no meaningful difference in that situation right now. so a lot of them are still, uh, big phone apps. I would say. Instagram is still a giant phone app. Twitter is still a giant phone app. Tesla is still a giant phone app. Expedia stole a giant phone app. cash app is still not optimized. neither is Tick Tock. it still kind of looks weird. SoundCloud is like half optimized, I guess. Pocket Casts is also halfway there, looking like a giant phone app. overdrop weather is still a blown up phone app, and the list goes on and on. they have this thing where you can, uh, double tap the space to the left or to the right to move it over to the side, to make it more one-handable, but I mean, yeah, that's it, it's just a big phone app. the app ecosystem for Android tablets is still to this day, even now that this has arrived. it's still the biggest weakness of an Android tablet and the incentive it's got to be on developers, of course, but most of their incentive is to be as simple and streamlined as possible, and if you can just make one iPad app that covers all iPads, you'll do it, but if you can make one tablet app, it won't necessarily work on all Android tablets, so the incentive is still kind of tough. well, actually, there is one app that Google can say that they got optimized before the iPad, and that's the calculator. they did do a full scientific, not scientific, but a full-on calculator. there's a history over here to the side there's the readout which you can change the size of a light and dark theme. all this stuff. it's pretty good, your move, Apple. some other little random things that didn't quite fit into the full review: uh, when it's docked on the charger, it default charges up to 90, not 100, but I do think that's smart. IT preserves the battery life overall. there's also no headphone jack on this tablet, just so you know. and then, in case you're wondering, the camera quality is very much in line with the rest of this tablet's Hardware: pretty mid. it's good enough for basic video calls and document scanning, but nobody's shooting any movies on this thing. at the end of the day, though, my conclusion is this: two in one devices are typically- they're funny because they're- they're always like- slightly worse at one of the things that they're trying to be. this is a two in one device. it's a tablet and it's a smart home hub, so I was wondering, as I got it like, what is it going to be compromised at? is it worse at one or worse at the other? turns out it's a decent, cheap Android tablet and it's a slightly below average speaker dock home hub. uh, but that's fine. I think those two things are close enough together and are simple enough that it makes sense at least. I would personally love a super high-end version of this. I'd be so down for like a 120 hertz super fast, nice, premium tablet that also could dock whenever I want on a nice speaker and become like this high-end, like Boombox thing. but I also know that that would be super expensive and would have a much, much smaller Target demographic and probably wouldn't sell enough to exist well. so this is the thing that makes sense and I think it may actually sell a decent amount and we'll see how it does until the next one. thanks for watching catch in the next one. peace foreign [Music]."}, {"title": "Apple's Forbidden Words", "description": "There's a few words that Apple literally never says on stage.

couple\nyears of watching Apple presentations\nand it just became much more obvious\nwatching their latest which was WWDC\nbecause in this presentation Apple went\nthrough 45 minutes on stage talking\nabout their New Vision Pro headset and\nthey didn't say the words virtual\nreality on stage once and just in\ngeneral there are certain words that\nApple just refuses to say or generally\ndoesn't like to reference at all in any\nof their presentations or any of their\nmarketing and it's fascinating to watch\nso what are those words and why is Apple\ndoing this so let me start with the why\nnow obviously I'm not Apple so this is\nfrom the outside looking in but there\nare two really good reasons for why they\ndo what they do or why they don't say\nwhat they don't say and those are\ncontrol and comparison so control first\nI've already talked about Apple a big\nreason for a lot of what they do is\nbeing able to fully control over\neverything as much as possible and that\nextends to PR2 or it doesn't even have\nto be PR it's just smart branding but if\nyou come out with a new product and you\nassociate it heavily with a word that\nthe general public already uses or that\nanother company some competitors are\nalready using heavily for a bunch of\ndifferent things\nthen you run the risk that the sentiment\naround that word might actually change\nand might actually have a downturn at\nsome point in the future thus dragging\nthe whole reputation of your product\ndown with it so here's another commonly\nnever used word in apple presentations\nAI Apple just doesn't say Artificial\nIntelligence on stage now if you want\nsome contrast go back just a few weeks\nago to Google's developer conference\njust a Google I O and they introduced a\nbunch of features on stage in Android\nand in Chrome and let's just say they\nweren't shy about what was powering it\nas an AI first company ai ai ai\ngenerative AI generative AI generative\nai ai\na-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i so I mean\npretty clearly they love leaning into\nthat but apple on the other hand also\nintroduced at their developer conference\nWWDC a bunch of software features in iOS\nand Mac OS and they use the words AI or\nArtificial Intelligence on stage exactly\nzero times\nthey never said it now they did use\nphrases like machine learning and ML and\nthey talked about how a Transformer\nmodel is being run local on device that\nwill help auto correct in the new\nkeyboard in iOS 17 things like that but\nat no point did they call themselves an\nAI first company or proudly Proclaim\nthat they have a bunch of new features\npowered by AI to show us today nothing\nlike that and I think that's because\nclearly AI is such a big thing that it\nkind of has this public Persona that\nalso has a bit of a dark side it's got a\nit's a bit of a controversial word in\nsome areas we've talked about how AI art\nis sometimes accused of stealing from\nreal artists I made a whole video about\nthat I'll have a link below\num and so the word is so much that if\nyou're appleing you care so much about\nyour Public Image you don't want to risk\nattaching yourself to that word that you\ncan't control\nso they just don't they literally just\ndon't say it so that's control\nuh the other thing like I said is\ncomparison and this is a funny one too\nwith Apple so if you've ever watched an\napple presentation which most of us have\nthere are some pretty common themes that\nyou see every time you see the high\nproduction value a variety of presenters\nunlabeled graphs Craig's power stance\nbut as a tech reviewer one thing I've\nalso noticed and I think any other\njournalist or anyone covering these\ncompanies probably also notices to a\npoint is that Apple just kind of avoids\ncomparing themselves or even talking\nabout or acknowledging other companies\nor other products at all they kind of\njust like to pretend that they are the\nonly company in the world and they exist\nin this little ecosystem of just Apple\nstuff and other stuff just sort of Fades\naway now there are a few notable\nexceptions to this rule like they do\nevery once in a while mention oh our new\nlaptop is X percent faster than the most\npopular PC laptop or something like that\nthey'll do that once in a while but\nreally in general they do it far less\nthan the other companies especially\nactually have watched it a lot in the\nsmartphone space if you watch another\nsmartphone product unveiling a lot of\nthem will do straight up spec\ncomparisons to others and like just\nnumber comparisons you know our folding\nphone has a new 4 800 milliamp hour\nbattery which makes it the biggest\nbattery in any foldable in this category\noh our new phone has a 200 megapixel\ncamera which makes it the highest\nresolution ever in a smartphone oh our\nnew display refreshes at 165 Hertz\nmaking it 20 percent more responsive\nthan the next best thing all this stuff\nApple doesn't really like to do this\ntype of comparison instead they would\nmuch rather name\neverything now I'm not just talking\nabout the products of course they name\nthings like the iPhone and the mac and\nthe airpods and the software also has\nextremely functional names you have iOS\niPad OS Mac OS wash OS TV OS Vision OS\nbut they also like to take technical\nachievements and Technical features and\nbrand them put a name on them they name\neverything so instead of 120 hertz High\nrefresh rate ltpo display we've got\npromotion instead of an optical\nfingerprint reader we have Touch ID\ninstead of a large linear vibration\nmotor it's a taptic engine instead of\nthe latest version of glass from their\nsupplier it's ceramic shield now of\ncourse everyone knows the value of good\ncatchy branding but when you brand\nsomething for yourself instead of using\nthe term that everyone else uses that\nspecifically makes your version a little\nbit harder to compare to everyone else's\nso while all the other companies are\ntalking about okay we got to 120 hertz\nbut now we we've got 244 Hertz and now\nour gaming phone is 165 Hertz So it's 15\nmore responsive than their 144 Hertz and\nApple's over here like we have Pro\nmotion and this version of promotion is\nmore responsive and smooth than any\nother Pro motion we've ever had like\nthey hardly ever use ip68 or IP67 on\nstage as much as they just like saying\nit's dust and water resistant again and\nthere's hole punch cutouts in the top of\nthe AMOLED display of every other phone\nin the store but ours with our software\non top is a dynamic Island there's\nactually a whole page of these just on\nApple's site I'll link it below just\njust trademarked names of things that\nthey've put their stamp on some are\nprograms some are features some\ntechnologies there's a lot of them\nclearly they're not the only ones who do\nthis but it's just the most consistent\nthing about all of their presentations\nand the cherry on top of all this is a\nlot of times Apple doesn't even really\nlike saying at all ever what the actual\nspec is they'll leave it to you to find\nout later and Tech reviewers are really\ndigging and figure it out but when's the\nlast time you ever saw the milliamp hour\nsize of an iPhone mentioned in the\nKeynote\nlast time I checked they just don't do\nthat ever they'll just tell you it's the\nlongest battery life of any iPhone we've\never made that is the epitome of control\nand comparison now with the New Vision\nPro headset that Apple just unveiled in\nparticular it's interesting it's really\ninteresting I made a whole video just on\nI got to try it and my first impressions\nwith it if you somehow haven't seen that\nyet I'll link it below\num but it's also pretty clear based on\nwhat we know that Apple has future plans\nwith this to make it cheaper of course\nbut to also make it smaller and higher\nTech and better and better to the point\nwhere the tech sort of just Fades away\nand you have a pair of glasses that you\nlook through and still have all the\ntechnology and function from so they\nnever really want to call The Vision Pro\na VR headset even though it totally is\nbecause of the Ambitions that they have\nto steer this this vision and the\ncontrol that they have no pun intended\ntowards mostly AR stuff so you'll see\nall kinds of Demos in the videos of a\nvirtual reality headset with really good\npass through like when you go into that\ntheater demo for one like you're in\ncomplete darkness with a huge screen in\nfront of you I mean that's literally a\nVR headset but they want to steer you so\nmuch towards thinking of vision as an\naugmented reality experience and that's\nmuch easier if you just never say\nvirtual reality out loud at all the\nclosest they got was talking about how\nyou can spin the digital crown and fully\nimmerse yourself beyond the dimensions\nof your physical room with features\ncalled environments\nand there it is they've managed to Brand\nvirtual reality with a different name so\nthey can control it and manage what it's\ncompared to over time they also didn't\nsay a whole lot about the specs on stage\npart of it of course is because this is\nsomething that's coming out uh early\nnext year so it's not done maybe some\nthings change between now and then but\nthey still didn't say a refresh rate on\nstage they didn't say a field of view\nnumber in degrees like they avoided a\nlot of the things that pretty much every\nother VR headset and maker out there\nwould put in their presentation but\nthere was no shortage at all of naming\nthings and setting the tone for how they\nwant us to think about this headset\ngoing forward so the next time you're\nwatching an apple presentation or some\nkeynote there's a lot of impressive\nthings to pay attention to you know the\ngraphics the transitions the Drone shots\nthe power stances\nbut it's the words\npay attention to the words\nthanks for watching\ncatch you guys in the next one\npeace\n", "punctuated_text": "hey, what's up. I'm Kim BHD here, and did you notice something? I've been thinking a lot about this over the past couple years of watching Apple presentations, and it just became much more obvious watching their latest, which was WWDC, because in this presentation, Apple went through 45 minutes on stage talking about their New Vision Pro headset and they didn't say the words virtual reality on stage once and just. in general, there are certain words that Apple just refuses to say or generally doesn't like to reference at all in any of their presentations or any of their marketing, and it's fascinating to watch. so what are those words and why is Apple doing this? so let me start with the why. now, obviously I'm not Apple, so this is from the outside looking in. but there are two really good reasons for why they do what they do or why they don't say what they don't say, and those are control and comparison. so control first. I've already talked about Apple. a big reason for a lot of what they do is being able to fully control over everything as much as possible, and that extends to PR2, or it doesn't even have to be PR, it's just smart branding. but if you come out with a new product and you associate it heavily with a word that the general public already uses or that another company, some competitors, are already using heavily for a bunch of different things, then you run the risk that the sentiment around that word might actually change and might actually have a downturn at some point in the future, thus dragging the whole reputation of your product down with it. so here's another commonly never used word in apple presentations: AI. Apple just doesn't say Artificial Intelligence on stage. now, if you want some contrast, go back just a few weeks ago to Google's developer conference. just a Google I, O, and they introduced a bunch of features on stage in Android and in Chrome and let's just say they weren't shy about what was powering it as an AI first company: ai, ai, ai, generative AI, generative AI, generative ai, ai, a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i. so I mean pretty clearly they love leaning into that. but apple, on the other hand, also introduced at their developer conference, WWDC, a bunch of software features in iOS and Mac OS, and they use the words AI or Artificial Intelligence on stage exactly zero times. they never said it. now. they did use phrases like machine learning and ML and they talked about how a Transformer model is being run local on device that will help auto correct in the new keyboard in iOS 17, things like that. but at no point did they call themselves an AI first company or proudly Proclaim that they have a bunch of new features powered by AI to show us today. nothing like that, and I think that's because clearly, AI is such a big thing that it kind of has this public Persona that also has a bit of a dark side. it's got a- it's a bit of a controversial word in some areas. we've talked about how AI art is sometimes accused of stealing from real artists. I made a whole video about that. I'll have a link below. um, and so the word is so much that if you're appleing, you care so much about your Public Image- you don't want to risk attaching yourself to that word that you can't control. so they just don't, they literally just don't say it. so that's control. uh, the other thing, like I said, is comparison- and this is a funny one too, with Apple. so if you've ever watched an apple presentation, which most of us have, there are some pretty common themes that you see every time. you see the high production value, a variety of presenters, unlabeled graphs, Craig's power stance. but as a tech reviewer, one thing I've also noticed- and I think any other journalist or anyone covering these companies probably also notices to a point- is that Apple just kind of avoids comparing themselves or even talking about or acknowledging other companies or other products at all. they kind of just like to pretend that they are the only company in the world and they exist in this little ecosystem of just Apple stuff and other stuff just sort of Fades away. now there are a few notable exceptions to this rule, like they do every once in a while. mention: oh, our new laptop is X percent faster than the most popular PC laptop or something like that. they'll do that once in a while, but really in general they do it far less than the other companies. especially actually have watched it a lot in the smartphone space. if you watch another smartphone product unveiling, a lot of them will do straight up spec comparisons to others and like just number comparisons. you know our folding phone has a new 4 800 milliamp hour battery, which makes it the biggest battery in any foldable in this category. oh, our new phone has a 200 megapixel camera, which makes it the highest resolution ever in a smartphone. oh, our new display refreshes at 165 Hertz, making it 20 percent more responsive than the next best thing. all this stuff. Apple doesn't really like to do this type of comparison. instead, they would much rather name everything. now I'm not just talking about the products, of course. they name things like the iPhone and the mac and the airpods, and the software also has extremely functional names. you have iOS, iPad OS, Mac OS, wash OS, TV OS, Vision OS, but they also like to take technical achievements and Technical features and brand them, put a name on them. they name everything. so instead of 120 hertz High refresh rate ltpo display, we've got promotion. instead of an optical fingerprint reader, we have Touch ID. instead of a large linear vibration motor, it's a taptic engine. instead of the latest version of glass from their supplier, it's ceramic shield. now, of course, everyone knows the value of good, catchy branding, but when you brand something for yourself instead of using the term that everyone else uses, that specifically makes your version a little bit harder to compare to everyone else's. so while all the other companies are talking about, okay, we got to 120 hertz, but now we we've got 244 Hertz, and now our gaming phone is 165 Hertz. So it's 15 more responsive than their 144 Hertz and Apple's over here. like we have Pro motion and this version of promotion is more responsive and smooth than any other Pro motion we've ever had. like they hardly ever use ip68 or IP67 on stage as much as they just like saying. it's dust and water resistant again, and there's hole punch cutouts in the top of the AMOLED display of every other phone in the store, but ours, with our software on top, is a dynamic Island. there's actually a whole page of these just on Apple's site. I'll link it below. just just trademarked names of things that they've put their stamp on. some are programs, some are features, some technologies. there's a lot of them. clearly they're not the only ones who do this, but it's just the most consistent thing about all of their presentations. and the cherry on top of all this is a lot of times Apple doesn't even really like saying at all ever what the actual spec is. they'll leave it to you to find out later, and Tech reviewers are really digging and figure it out. but when's the last time you ever saw the milliamp hour size of an iPhone mentioned in the Keynote? last time I checked they just don't do that ever. they'll just tell you it's the longest battery life of any iPhone we've ever made. that is the epitome of control and comparison now with the New Vision Pro headset that Apple just unveiled in particular. it's interesting, it's really interesting. I made a whole video just on. I got to try it and my first impressions with it. if you somehow haven't seen that yet, I'll link it below. um, but it's also pretty clear, based on what we know, that Apple has future plans with this to make it cheaper, of course, but to also make it smaller and higher Tech and better and better, to the point where the tech sort of just Fades away and you have a pair of glasses that you look through and still have all the technology and function from. so they never really want to call The Vision Pro a VR headset, even though it totally is because of the Ambitions that they have to steer this, this vision and the control that they have- no pun intended- towards mostly AR stuff. so you'll see all kinds of Demos in the videos of a virtual reality headset with really good pass through, like when you go into that theater demo for one, like you're in complete darkness with a huge screen in front of you. I mean that's literally a VR headset, but they want to steer you so much towards thinking of vision as an augmented reality experience, and that's much easier if you just never say virtual reality out loud at all. the closest they got was talking about how you can spin the digital crown and fully immerse yourself beyond the dimensions of your physical room with features called environments. and there it is. they've managed to Brand virtual reality with a different name so they can control it and manage what it's compared to over time. they also didn't say a whole lot about the specs on stage. part of it, of course, is because this is something that's coming out, uh, early next year, so it's not done. maybe some things change between now and then. but they still didn't say a refresh rate on stage. they didn't say a field of view number in degrees, like they avoided a lot of the things that pretty much every other VR headset and maker out there would put in their presentation, but there was no shortage at all of naming things and setting the tone for how they want us to think about this headset going forward. so the next time you're watching an apple presentation or some keynote, there's a lot of impressive things to pay attention to. you know the graphics, the transitions, the Drone shots, the power stances, but it's the words. pay attention to the words. thanks for watching. catch you guys in the next one. peace."}, {"title": "15\" MacBook Air M2 Review: The Obvious Thing!", "description": "The bigger MacBook Air made too much sense.\n\n15\" M2 MacBook Air:

"foreign\nMacBook Air review this laptop\nthankfully is exactly what you think it\nis it's a MacBook Air\nbut bigger this is the Tesla Model y of\nlaptops you see the Tesla Model 3 was\nthe most important model for Tesla they\nhad other more expensive flagships but\nthis was the entry level attainable\nversion for the masses and it quickly\nbecame their most recommended and\nbest-selling car and it's the way that\nmost people got into Tesla and formed\ntheir first Tesla experience but\nsneakily bigger cars are actually more\npopular and in America especially people\ncan't help but want a version that's a\nlittle bigger a little higher off the\nground so they did the obvious thing and\nmade Tesla Model y it's built on the\nsame platform as a model 3 but a little\nbigger and a little higher off the\nground and pretty much instantly has\nrocketed up to the top of the lineup to\nthe point where it's now the most\npopular new car on planet Earth\nsee the MacBook Air was the most\nimportant Mac for Apple I mean they had\nother expensive flagships but this was\nthe most entry-level attainable model\nfor the masses and it quickly became\ntheir most recommended and best-selling\nMac as the first first way most people\ngot into the mac and formed their first\nMac OS experiences but sneakily bigger\nscreens are actually the most popular\nand in America especially people can't\nhelp but want a version with a little\nbit of a bigger screen so they did the\nobvious thing and made the 15-inch\nMacBook Air it's built on the same\nplatform as the 14-inch MacBook Air but\na little bit bigger screen and I predict\nit'll pretty much instantly rock it to\nthe top of the lineup to the point where\nit is the most popular 50-inch laptop\nand the most popular Mac on planet Earth\nwe kind of already know what the M2\nMacBook Air is if you haven't already\nseen it I'll link the review right with\nthe like button that covers it my only\nreal question is going into the review\nof the bigger one were one is there any\nreal benefit to the bigger screen how\nmuch better is it really and two are\nthere any other benefits to getting a\nbigger laptop so I think the whole\nbigger screen thing is pretty clear\nthere are literally millions of people\nwho today go into stores and ask for a\n15-inch laptop and when they did Apple\nwould have to bring people over to the\n16-inch MacBook Pro as their cheapest\noption which starts at twenty five\nhundred dollars so now they have this\nnow is there a dramatically more\ninformation that can fit on the screen\nnot really is it a dramatically better\nquality display than the smaller one nah\nit mostly just feels bigger uh bigger\nvideos bigger movies bigger texts bigger\nWindows just just a little more room for\neverything to be a little bit bigger and\nyou only pay for that really with a\nlittle bit of extra size as far as the\nlaptop goes this thing is still 11 and a\nhalf millimeters thin and weighs 3.3\npounds it's super slim it's a quarter of\na millimeter thicker and half a pound\nheavier than the smaller MacBook Air\nwhich I kind of mentioned this earlier\nbut I forgot that basically already has\n14 inch diagonal screens with its\nthinner bezels so you can really just\nmeasure out 1.3 extra inches diagonally\nto get to the proper 15.3 inch laptop\nsize still it has decently thin bezels\nnot the thinnest in the world still has\nthe notch cut out for face ID I mean\nsorry no face ID it has just a webcam\nand a microphone it still just as Touch\nID on the keyboard and nothing else\nabout the display itself really has\nchanged it's the same Tech the same\npixel density the same brightness 500\nnits 60 hertz it's fine the screen is\nfine it's just bigger so all right now\nthat the whole footprint of the laptop\nis also bigger what more can you get out\nof that uh first of all sneaky slightly\nbigger track pad so the keyboard is the\nsame size but actually the trackpad does\nget a little bit bigger which is nice\nkind of matches the larger display and\nalso there is more room inside for\nspeakers so Apple's added not bigger\nspeakers but just actually a second set\nof force canceling woofers which would\ntheoretically make the sound a little\npunchier maybe add some bass and I I can\nsay it is louder it does get louder\noverall and have a bit more bass than\nthe smaller MacBook Air but it's not\nlike game changing I'm impressed that\nthey can get loud without distorting but\nthey are not close to the maybe unfair\n16 inch MacBook Pro speakers but just to\ngive you an idea of the context also\nsome people have noted it looks kind of\nweird to have like no speaker grilles\nthe left and right of the keyboard but\nthe speakers are still in the same place\nas they were in the smaller one up in\nthe hinge of the MacBook Air and then\nthere's also more room inside for bigger\nbattery and my experience actually lines\nup pretty well with what Apple said\nwhich is look it's the same chipset very\nsimilar laptop bigger screen and bigger\nbattery sort of cancel each other out\nand you end up with roughly the same\nbattery life as a smaller machine it has\nto say it's quite good full workday of\nbattery life pretty much guaranteed\nmultiple light days in a row no problem\nso then the last thing I wanted to test\nis actually is there a difference in\nperformance between the small M2 MacBook\nAir and the big one since theoretically\nthere is just a little more room inside\nfor a little extra thermal Headroom like\nthere's no way it's significant but\nthese are very different size laptops\nand the old one when it was torn apart\ndidn't have a heat sink so maybe there's\nroom for a little passive heatsink in\nthis one they're both fanless but I had\nto check it so in single core bursty\nperformance I never expect to see any\ndifference and I really didn't I ran off\nback-to-back geekbench 6 benchmarks\nsmall drop off after the first one for\neach but no noticeable difference but\nthen I ran back to back 10 minute\ncinebench multi-core benchmarks which\nkind of just run continuously to test\nsome more reliable sustained workloads\nand there was a slightly bigger dip on\nthe smaller M2 air and so potentially\nyes over time this may add up to a bit\nmore thermal throttling but my\nconclusion is you can see the numbers on\npaper but this difference is unlikely to\nbe noticeable like I said they're both\nrunning the M2 Chip and most behavior on\nlaptops like this is so bursty and short\nthat they perform basically identically\nbut if you do happen to get into those\nlong multi-minit sustained workloads in\na row like we're exporting a video\nediting a video gaming even then maybe\nyou'd notice a little bit more out of\nthis bigger one over time but you'll\nnotice the bigger difference on the\n14-inch MacBook Pro which is just a\nlittle bit above this one in price so if\nyou know you're going to be doing\nworkloads like that then you probably\nare looking at a Pro laptop but matter\nof fact let's just talk about what I\nthink is the biggest X Factor with this\nlaptop the biggest hurdle between this\nand being the Tesla Model y of laptops\nis the price so this Baseline version\nthis little Starlight one which kind of\nalmost matches this a little bit a\nlittle sand color starts at 12.99 and\nthat is the base version which you you\ncan't upgrade these laptops over time so\nyou tend to want to get as much as you\ncan out of the initial purchase this\nbase version only has eight gigs of\nshared memory and 256 gigs of storage\nthat can actually pretty quickly become\na 1700 laptop with just a few clicks to\nupgrade those things and that's a that's\npricey so there's a lot of Windows\nlaptops that you can get at that price\nthat will probably do one specific thing\nbetter than this one whether it's the\nXPS 15 with a nicer display or the Rog\nzephyrus which is going to be better for\ngaming and has more ports you can get\nflipping and folding laptops that spin\nover backwards and gaming laptops even\nbut none of them will be quite the\npackage that this this is which is a\nreally thin and light daily 15 inch\nscreen laptop like this is kind of just\nthe ultimate Baseline for most people's\nactivities so to have all those things\nsort of well-rounded into one the\nthinness and lightness the nice display\nthe great battery life the impressive\nperformance from the M2 that's what\nmakes this the MacBook Air it's got the\nA1 build quality it's got the

other more expensive flagships, but this was the entry level, attainable version for the masses and it quickly became their most recommended and best-selling car and it's the way that most people got into Tesla and formed their first Tesla experience. but sneakily bigger cars are actually more popular and in America especially, people can't help but want a version that's a little bigger, a little higher off the ground. so they did the obvious thing and made Tesla Model y. it's built on the same platform as a model 3, but a little bigger and a little higher off the ground, and pretty much instantly has rocketed up to the top of the lineup, to the point where it's now the most popular new car on planet Earth. see, the MacBook Air was the most important Mac for Apple. I mean, they had other expensive flagships, but this was the most entry-level, attainable model for the masses and it quickly became their most recommended and best-selling Mac. as the first, first way, most people got into the mac and formed their first Mac OS experiences. but sneakily bigger screens are actually the most popular and in America especially, people can't help but want a version with a little bit of a bigger screen. so they did the obvious thing and made the 15-inch MacBook Air. it's built on the same platform as the 14-inch MacBook Air, but a little bit bigger screen, and I predict it'll pretty much instantly rock it to the top of the lineup, to the point where it is the most popular 50-inch laptop and the most popular Mac on planet Earth. we kind of already know what the M2 MacBook Air is. if you haven't already seen it, I'll link the review right with the like button. that covers it. my only real question is, going into the review of the bigger one were. one, is there any real benefit to the bigger screen? how much better is it really? and two, are there any other benefits to getting a bigger laptop? so I think the whole bigger screen thing is pretty clear. there are literally millions of people who today go into stores and ask for a 15-inch laptop, and when they did, Apple would have to bring people over to the 16-inch MacBook Pro as their cheapest option, which starts at twenty five hundred dollars. so now they have this now? is there a dramatically more information that can fit on the screen? not really. is it a dramatically better quality display than the smaller one? nah, it mostly just feels bigger, uh, bigger videos, bigger movies, bigger texts, bigger Windows- just just a little more room for everything to be a little bit bigger, and you only pay for that, really, with a little bit of extra size. as far as the laptop goes, this thing is still 11 and a half millimeters thin and weighs 3.3 pounds. it's super slim. it's a quarter of a millimeter thicker and half a pound heavier than the smaller MacBook Air, which- I kind of mentioned this earlier but I forgot that- basically already has 14 inch diagonal screens with its thinner bezels. so you can really just measure out 1.3 extra inches diagonally to get to the proper 15.3 inch laptop size. still, it has decently thin bezels, not the thinnest in the world- still has the notch cut out for face ID. I mean, sorry, no face ID. it has just a webcam and a microphone. it still just as Touch ID on the keyboard, and nothing else about the display itself really has changed. it's the same Tech, the same pixel density, the same brightness, 500 nits, 60 hertz. it's fine, the screen is fine, it's just bigger. so all right, now that the whole footprint of the laptop is also bigger. what more can you get out of that? uh, first of all sneaky slightly bigger track pad, so the keyboard is the same size, but actually the trackpad does get a little bit bigger, which is nice, kind of matches the larger display. and also there is more room inside for speakers. so Apple's added not bigger speakers but just actually a second set of force canceling woofers which would theoretically make the sound a little punchier. maybe add some bass and I I can say it is louder. it does get louder overall and have a bit more bass than the smaller MacBook Air, but it's not like game changing. I'm impressed that they can get loud without distorting, but they are not close to the maybe unfair 16 inch MacBook Pro speakers. but just to give you an idea of the context also, some people have noted it looks kind of weird to have like no speaker grilles the left and right of the keyboard, but the speakers are still in the same place as they were in the smaller one, up in the hinge of the MacBook Air. and then there's also more room inside for bigger battery and my experience actually lines up pretty well with what Apple said, which is: look, it's the same chipset, very similar laptop, bigger screen and bigger battery sort of cancel each other out and you end up with roughly the same battery life as a smaller machine. it has to say it's quite good: full workday of battery life, pretty much guaranteed, multiple light days in a row, no problem. so then the last thing I wanted to test is actually, is there a difference in performance between the small M2 MacBook Air and the big one, since, theoretically, there is just a little more room inside for a little extra thermal Headroom, like there's no way it's significant, but these are very different size laptops and the old one, when it was torn apart, didn't have a heat sink, so maybe there's room for a little passive heatsink in this one. they're both fanless, but I had to check it. so in single core bursty performance I never expect to see any difference, and I really didn't. I ran off back-to-back geekbench 6 benchmarks- small drop off after the first one for each, but no noticeable difference. but then I ran back to back 10 minute cinebench multi-core benchmarks which kind of just run continuously to test some more reliable, sustained workloads, and there was a slightly bigger dip on the smaller M2 air and so potentially- yes, over time this may add up to a bit more thermal throttling. but my conclusion is you can see the numbers on paper, but this difference is unlikely to be noticeable. like I said, they're both running the M2 Chip and most behavior on laptops like this is so bursty and short that they perform basically identically. but if you do happen to get into those long, multi-minit, sustained workloads in a row, like we're exporting a video, editing a video, gaming- even then maybe you'd notice a little bit more out of this bigger one over time. but you'll notice the bigger difference on the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which is just a little bit above this one in price. so if you know you're going to be doing workloads like that, then you probably are looking at a Pro laptop. but, matter of fact, let's just talk about what I think is the biggest X Factor with this laptop. the biggest hurdle between this and being the Tesla Model y of laptops is the price. so this Baseline version, this little Starlight one which kind of almost matches this a little bit, a little sand color, starts at 12.99 and that is the base version which you. you can't upgrade these laptops over time, so you tend to want to get as much as you can out of the initial purchase. this base version only has eight gigs of shared memory and 256 gigs of storage. that can actually pretty quickly become a 1700 laptop with just a few clicks to upgrade those things, and that's a that's pricey. so there's a lot of Windows laptops that you can get at that price that will probably do one specific thing better than this one, whether it's the XPS 15 with a nicer display, or the Rog zephyrus, which is going to be better for gaming and has more ports. you can get flipping and folding laptops that spin over backwards and gaming laptops even, but none of them will be quite the package that this this is, which is a really thin and light daily 15 inch screen laptop like this is kind of just the ultimate Baseline for most people's activities. so to have all those things sort of well-rounded into one- the thinness and lightness, the nice display, the great battery life, the impressive performance from the M2- that's what makes this the MacBook Air. it's got the A1 build quality. it's got the color matching braided magsafe cable which also connects to the 35 watt charging brick with dual USBC ports, which you could actually swap out for a slightly larger, 70 watt brick with a single port for faster charging. that's a free swap on Apple site. and of course you can't forget the ecosystem stuff, the messages, the FaceTime, Etc. all the stuff that plugs into Apple's World. despite its potentially premium price, people will pounce on this popular pick. thanks for watching. catch you guys. the next one. peace.

headset I had about a\ntrillion questions so I tried to ask as\nmany of them as I possibly could of\nApple to get all the answers I could for\nyou and for myself so without any\nfurther Ado let's just jump right in\nthis is everything you need to know so\nfar about Apple's new AR VR headset so\nthe first question naturally what is it\nso first things first this is a first\ngeneration device from Apple which we\ndon't see very often but it is an\naugmented reality slash virtual reality\nheadset with a bunch of cameras and\nsensors inside that you strap to your\nface it'll start at three thousand five\nhundred dollars and it'll go on sale\nstarting sometime early next year\nnobody's been able to shoot video of\nusing it yet so I'm gonna have to do my\nbest with descriptions here but\nfundamentally this isn't something\nthat's paired to your iPhone or your Mac\nby default it's a standalone computer\nwith an M2 Chip inside its own Wi-Fi\nconnection a roughly 4K micro OLED\ndisplay for each eye a set of speakers\nright above each ear on the band and\nthen a dedicated new R1 chip which is\ndoing all of the real-time processing\nfrom all the sensors that make this\nheadset pretty special but we'll get to\nthat in a second so all right then how\ndoes it work well basically we've seen\nVR headsets and AR headsets before it's\nuh typically there's screens on the\ninside and then on the outside there's\nsome sort of shell which has some\nsensors on the outside that help detect\nwhat is in your room around you and help\nto see the controllers in your hands but\nwith this one there are no controllers\nat all they're not making any for it\nthere aren't going to be any optional\naccessory they're not even going to\ndesign any controllers you are\ncontrolling this thing entirely with\nyour hands and your eyes and your voice\nso you put this headset on and basically\nall over the headset there are an\nabsolute ton of sensors you have two\nmain forward-facing cameras two down\ndownward facing cameras two more cameras\nfor the sides two infrared illuminators\na lidar scanner a true depth camera\nthese are all to keep track of what's\nhappening around the headset and also to\ntrack your hands in front of your face\nand then on the inside there's also a\nbunch of infrared illuminators and\ninfrared cameras that are purely there\njust there to track your eyes so there's\nactually a setup process before you even\nget the headset you basically measure\nyou sort of scan your face with the true\ndepth camera on the iPhone and it uses\nthat depth information about your face\nto give you sort of a custom cut out\nthis will be a process that you can do\nin Apple Stores but basically you get\nthe headset with the custom cut out for\nyour face if you have glasses there are\nsome Zeiss lenses but you finally get\nthe headset out and you put it on and\nthere's some nice meshing on the back\nsome fabric that stretches and is pretty\nbreathable it's built extremely well\nwith all this metal and glass and then\nonce you get it going the most\nimpressive thing about this headset the\nmost impressive thing is the eye\ntracking\nI'm not even kidding this this eye\ntracking is sick so basically the eye\ntracking in this headset as it looks at\nyour eyes and keeps track of where your\neyes move around is the closest thing\nthat I've experienced to like magic like\nI don't I normally don't call Tech\nthings sort of magical or surreal like\nthis but this was even for a pre-release\nproduct\nkind of unbelievable how well it does\nanytime you move your eyes around the UI\nit would immediately highlight and\nselect exactly what you're looking at no\nmatter how small the target was or what\nyou're looking at and then when you want\nto select something all you do is take\nyour fingers like this and just touch\nthem together that's how you click so\nyou look at something click look at\nsomething click so there's actually\nthere's a calibration process when you\nfirst set up the headset you put it on\nfor the first time where you basically\njust look around with your eyes at a\nbunch of different dots so it learns\nyour eyes and then yeah from that point\non you're just cruising you're sailing\nthrough everything by just looking at\nthings and it feels like telepathic you\njust look at something and select it and\nthat's it so this is how the whole UI\nworks pretty much every other headset\nhas the ability to use your hands to\nselect things but most of them rely on\nthe sensors on the outside to keep track\nof a set of controllers for maximum\naccuracy but this massive array of\nsensors on the outside of Apple's\nheadset have done an impressively good\njob of picking up what my hand is doing\nkind of no matter where it is so like I\nsaid there's sensors all the way around\nthe thing they're facing forward but\nthey're facing sideways and facing down\nso I can just kind of rest my hand like\nwherever and look at stuff and click I\ndon't even have to move my head I can\njust look at something and just click my\nfingers I kind of did it by accident a\nfew times like I just sort of be sitting\nthere and my fingertips would actually\ntouch and I'd select whatever I was\nlooking at but pretty quickly you get\nused to just\njust this just just doing this now there\nare also some text boxes occasionally\nyou want to type something and so you\ncan look at the text box select it and\nthen a keyboard will pop up and you can\nlook at the letters but also you can\njust look at a search box field and just\nstart talking and it'll start filling in\nwhatever you're saying because there's\nmicrophones on the headset and there's\nalso something they're calling optic ID\nwhich is basically kind of just the\nfingerprint ID of the headset because\nit's looking at your eyes and everyone's\neyes is a different unique biometric\npattern and so you log in just by\nputting a headset on and it looks at\nyour eyes so optic ID this thing knows\nyour eyes really well so you've probably\nseen all these weird looking frames\nwhere you can see people's eyes through\nit like this this super weird thing that\nI've never seen in any other headset so\nwhat is happening here well spoiler\nalert it's not actually transparent it\nkind of looks like it's a glass\ntransparent thing but it's not it\nappears to be because there's actually\nan OLED screen facing out this is what I\nwould call a 2 way pass-through that's\nwhat I'm calling it see a normal VR\nheadset we've seen is of course\ncompletely opaque usually it's like\nblack plastic or something like that so\nin order to see through to your actual\nenvironment without taking the headset\noff like for picking up your controllers\nor walking around a room without hitting\na wall they have a pass-through mode so\nit'll turn on a camera on the outside so\nyou can see what's going on around you\nand some pass-through modes are better\nthan others some will do it from a\nsingle black and white camera some will\ndo stereo pass through from two cameras\nsome will do color pass through\nthe pass-through on Apple's headset is\nagain the best I've ever seen in a\nheadset it's stereo it's color it's\nsharp it's real time\nit's really good so then the eyes you\nsee from the outside are actually an\nOLED display showing what your eyes look\nlike to the cameras inside the headset\nso it shows your eyes like this whenever\nyou're using any sort of pass-through\nmode and if you can see your environment\nit'll show your eyes so you're not\nactually like looking at someone's eyes\nbut it kind of feels like you are\nkind of creepy a little bit I don't know\nit's the simplest way of explaining it\nif they're doing something fully\nimmersive in VR like watching a movie or\nplaying a game then it won't show their\neyes it'll show this graphic over their\neyes instead it's a really interesting\nlook it's a it's a bold look I just have\nthis like thought of like you're uh\nyou're on a airplane and the flight\nattendant walks up and Taps you hey do\nyou want any water and you just look up\nand your eyes shine through the headset\nit's just a weird thing I don't think\nit's smart but I don't think other\nheadsets are gonna do it because most of\nthem don't have it in the budget to have\na screen facing the outside but then\nlet's get to the burning question you've\nprobably already been thinking what does\nit actually do so okay I'm sort of I'm\nseparating this into three bulk\ncategories that I made up and I'm kind\nof proud of here which are Computing\ncontent and connections now actually I\nshould preface this all by saying this\nis a first gen product so right now the\nonly apps that show up on the home\nscreen are Apple's apps just like when\nthe first iPhone came out with no app\nstore it's just Apple's apps but the\nreason this is coming out or at least\ngetting announced so early but it's not\ncoming out till next year is to give\nthis window for developers to start\ndeveloping their own apps and making\ncool things for this headset to do that\nare way more interesting and way more\nfunctional but it does have a core set\nof functions so for computing I think\nthis is the one that's probably the\nleast likely to be used by most normal\npeople but it is a pretty direct shot at\nwhat meta just did with the quest Pro\nthe 1500 Quest Pro so you can use this\nthing as its own computer with web\nbrowsing Etc with these 4K windows in\nfront of you that you can move around\nand do all kinds of stuff with your\nhands now this will be its own OS again\nit's not running off your phone or\nanything it's running a whole new\noperating system called Vision OS and it\nseems pretty similar pretty similar to\niPad OS just in the fact that you know\nyou're just touching things in iPad OS\nand in this headset you look at\nsomething and then you touch your\nfingers together and that's basically\njust like a normal touch but I was\nreally impressed with the responsiveness\nagain this was better than any headset\nI've seen with just your hands if I\nwanted to scroll through something like\na safari window I literally in air would\ntouch my fingers together and drag the\nwindow\nand it would scroll nearly in real time\nI would like throw it around like toss\nit catch it toss it the other way and\nstart scrolling through things with my\nfinger resizing Windows dragging the\ncorners of things\nand I was super impressed with that too\nnow if you're like me you might have\nalso had some questions about the\nsharpness like do I really want to wear\nsomething like this for a long time to\nwork like it's on a computer and I think\nI was also pretty smartly addressed they\nuse a selective rendering based on the\nsuper good eye tracking so the computing\npower is basically focusing on sharply\nrendering the part of the screen that\nyou're actually looking at while saving\npower on the rest it's pretty cool and\nit works so quickly that I did not\nnotice it while using it and then the\npart you're looking at is actually very\nsharp like I said before they're super\nhigh resolution screens they're 4K I\ndon't know if I have a number for\nrefresh rate but it felt like 120 hertz\nand you know I fatigue will eventually\nbecome a thing with any headset you\nstrapped to your face but this would be\non the lower level of eye fatigue\ncompared to what I've experienced with\nsome others and then for even more heavy\nwork this was kind of nuts but they\nshowed it in the keynote apparently if\nyou have a Mac and you want to do Mac OS\nstuff you can just with the headset on\njust look at your Mac and it will pick\nup what you're doing and it'll mirror\nthe max display as one of the 4K windows\nfor you in the headset and then you can\neven connect a Bluetooth keyboard and a\nBluetooth trackpad and start working\naround like it's an actual Mac just with\na bigger screen wherever you want\nat yeah ecosystem stuff so that's\nComputing I definitely got to try it but\nthen of course there's the uh the\nconnection stuff you got messaging you\ncan type out messages to people just\nlike as if you were on a Mac but there's\nalso impressively FaceTime now I don't\neven know that this is necessarily\nbetter than a normal FaceTime holding\nyour phone or like on a laptop other\nthan the fact that I guess you don't\nhave to be holding anything but you can\nhave people's windows floating in front\nof you as you talk to them on FaceTime\nbut you might also be asking wait a\nsecond if I'm not holding my phone in\nfront of me what do other people on\nFaceTime see well the answer is they'll\nsee a 3D rendered model of you that was\nscanned into the system from your iPhone\nthat syncs up and matches the movements\nof your face with eye tracking and all\nthe other sensors of the headset so I I\ngot to try it it is\nit works okay so it's it's it's not as\ngood as obviously looking at a person I\njust feel like a FaceTime you're trying\nto have like a personal connection with\nthe person and this is obviously more\npersonal than an avatar or like a\ncartoon of you but it's just it feels\nkind of somewhere in between it's kind\nof like a Google project Starline which\nI just did that video about a couple\nweeks ago if you haven't already seen\nthat I'll leave a link with a like\nbutton so you can check it out but it\nfeels sort of in that like uncanny\nvalley you know moving 3D model\nterritory instead of looking at an\nactual person it's kind of how I picture\nit but then last but not least of course\ncontent\npeople are just going to watch content\non this thing and I think this is the\nindustry now that Apple's jumping into\nit that is poised to explode like we've\nhad VR games and VR videos for a long\ntime and apple is now also able to do\nthis they of course put their own spin\non it and they can use the power and the\ndraw of the Apple brand to get content\ncreators and big motion picture studios\nand sports leagues and all kinds of\ncreatives to work to make content that\nlooks really good specifically on\nApple's headset and in Apple's formats I\ncan personally save from My Demo hell\nyes I would watch I would pay to watch\nan NBA game Courtside in the VR headset\nthe quality is good enough and obviously\nit's not going to be as immersive as\nfeeling the energy from the crowd but\nyou're not paying Courtside prices you'd\nprobably pay is a total guess 10 20\nbucks to watch an NBA game Courtside or\nhave some subscription to do that I\nwould totally do that and it would be\nfun but even with regular 2D content\nlike movies just watching a regular\nmovie you can totally just sit back put\nthe headset on maybe even put some\nheadphones on and just like on a plane\nseat just watch a movie as if you're in\na theater for one which is pretty sweet\nthere is that digital crown on the side\nthat actually lets you spin it clockwise\nto move in more immersion and fully\nenvelop you in the VR environment or you\ncan turn it counterclockwise to bring in\nmore of your real world environment with\npass-through in your peripheral vision\nkind of a neat trick and then there's\nalso this kind of weird feature where\nyou can take 3D photos and videos with\nthe cameras built into the headset\nitself and I did not like this one so\nthere was a demo of like a a recording\nfrom a headset camera of a kid blowing\nout some candles on a birthday cake\nbasically and I got to watch this actual\nscene in the actual Apple headset so\nbecause there's two cameras like\nfront-facing there they can record\nstereoscopic 3D so you can turn on the\nrecording and in that moment sit down\nand record a super immersive video and\nthen when you watch it back in the\nheadset it's like you're reliving this\nmoment in 3D which can feel kind of cool\nbut I just I can't get the image of like\nthe dad at the birthday party with the\nheadset on just recording things like\nwalking around it just doesn't\nit's what kind of memory is that for the\nother people around you you know like I\nsaw this and I immediately thought back\nto the the reasons we all know why\nGoogle Glass failed which is it was\nahead of its time but it's also like\nthey're walking around with a camera on\nyour face and everybody knows that you\nhave a camera on your face it just\nwasn't cool\ndad what are you doing why do you why\nare your eyes sticking out through the\nheadset so all right the number one\nquestion I've gotten after I've actually\ntried this thing is is it any good is\nthis headset any good and the answer is\nwell yes some of the parts of this\nheadset that I tried are actually the\nbest I have ever seen in any VR headset\nby a mile specifically the eye tracking\nand the Hand tracking now of course it's\ngoing to be up to developers to really\nmake it good but I think the\nfoundational like how do you use it part\nis pretty amazing but that doesn't mean\nthere aren't any downsides all right\nnumber one there was no haptics of\ncourse because you don't have\ncontrollers you're just doing everything\nwith your hands in the air there's no\nway to have any sort of haptic feedback\nthere was a demo that I did where like I\nstuck my hand out a wall on the other\nside of the room opened up and a\ndinosaur was back there and a butterfly\nflew out I held out my hand and the\nbutterfly flew up and landed on my\nfinger it could track and see all that\ninformation in the volumetric all the\ncomputation to make that happen was\namazing but when the butterfly landed\nand I didn't feel anything there was\nthat moment of like oh right this is a\nVR headset but then number two this was\ninteresting this is pretty heavy this is\na pretty heavy VR headset kind of the\nsame way that\num airpods max the Apple's metal\nheadphones are heavier than most plastic\nheadphones there's a reason why most\nother VR headsets are just plastic it's\nnot because that's cheap it's because\nit's lightweight it's fatiguing to have\na heavy thing on your head and this is a\nheadset made of metal and glass it's\nheavy now it is also super well built\nlike there is no arguing that but I do\nwonder about using it for longer than\nthe half hour that I did I wonder if it\nwould be more fatiguing to my head\nthat's also actually why the battery\nisn't attached to it that would be a ton\nof weight to carry on your head so they\nconnected the battery instead through a\nproprietary cable and that actually can\nsit next to you on the couch or in your\nback pocket and that brings us to the\nother thing the battery life\ntwo hours\ntwo hour battery life on the headset\nwhich is not that great it's not that\nlong now there's a USBC port on the\nbattery bank and you can plug that into\nthe wall for infinite time but the\nsecond you unplug from the wall yeah two\nhours from that pretty hefty battery\nbank which is like okay maybe most\npeople won't be spending a lot of time\nin the headset but you did also just\nshow us apple and AD of people like\nwatching a movie in the headset that's\nalready like most movies are two hours\nplus so something we're thinking about\nthere's just a two hour but I'm sure\npeople will make bigger external\nbatteries for this thing but two hours\nand then also I couldn't get a firm\nanswer here on if there are fans inside\nor not but\nI think they're stands like they're\ncertainly vents for fans anyway and if\nyou're gaming for long enough or using\nit for long enough do those spin up do\nthey ever get loud do they ever kill\nyour battery that's kind of unclear but\nthen of course the main thing that\neverybody's talking about it's expensive\nit's 3\n500 so is that pricey yeah that's very\nexpensive but this is the thing that is\nalways weird with Apple products like\nthere is no direct comp like I always\nyou always say it's expensive but like\ncompared to what and they they did this\nwith uh the pro display xdr they've done\nthis with even airpods Max a little bit\nbut like there there are several things\nthat this headset does that no other\nheadset does the eye tracking the hand\ntracking that's super good\neven if an equivalent headset came along\ntoday and did all of the same stuff that\nthis does hardware and software wise it\nstill wouldn't have face time it still\nwouldn't have like looking at a Mac and\nthen the ecosystem allowing the max\ndisplay to pop up so this is kind of\nsomething that only Apple could pull off\nso bottom line you know I got to try it\nI thought it was extremely impressive\nbut at the end of the day this is not a\nproduct for the masses I mean obviously\nright it's three thousand five hundred\ndollars it has the word Pro in the name\ntoo but this this feels like this series\nzero like the Apple Watch Remember When\nthe Apple watch first came out the\nseries zero where it's really going to\nbe up to the first gen the early\nadopters and the developers to decide\nthe direction that this thing goes to\ndecide what people actually want to use\nit for and that'll shape the future\nversions of it that we may eventually\nget down the road then maybe someday\nthere's like a a vision SE that's like\n400 bucks that the masses will all adopt\nand it'll be this next Generation hit\nproduct Maybe\nbut as of right now this is very much in\nthe sort of early adopter people like me\npeople like watching this video testing\nphase to figure it out so that's the\nApple Vision Pro it's uh it's it's the\nrich person's toy and the developers\nMuse for right now but we'll see how far\nthis thing goes in the near future it's\ncoming out next year it's not that far\noff it's not that far away it's really\ninteresting times either way this was\nalso part of a huge entire WWDC keynote\nso if you want to watch my recap of the\nrest of that stuff ideally get\nsubscribed because there's going to be a\nvideo recap of the biggest announcements\nof which there are many other things and\nalso uh I'll shout out the waveform\npodcast to get subscribed there too\nbecause the next episode I'll just say\nit it's a banger it's pretty sick so hit\nsub hit like hang out in the comments\nthat's been it for this one thanks for\nwatching\ncatch you guys in the next one peace\n", "punctuated_text": "foreign Pro. I had about a 30 minute demo just using this new headset. I had about a trillion questions, so I tried to ask as many of them as I possibly could of Apple to get all the answers I could for you and for myself. so, without any further Ado, let's just jump right in. this is everything you need to know so far about Apple's new AR VR headset. so the first question, naturally: what is it so? first things first. this is a first generation device from Apple which we don't see very often, but it is an augmented reality slash virtual reality headset with a bunch of cameras and sensors inside that you strap to your face. it'll start at three thousand five hundred dollars and it'll go on sale starting sometime early next year. nobody's been able to shoot video of using it yet, so I'm gonna have to do my best with descriptions here, but fundamentally, this isn't something that's paired to your iPhone or your Mac by default. it's a standalone computer with an M2 Chip inside its own Wi-Fi connection, a roughly 4K micro OLED display for each eye, a set of speakers right above each ear on the band and then a dedicated new R1 chip which is doing all of the real-time processing from all the sensors that make this headset pretty special, but we'll get to that in a second. so, all right then how does it work? well, basically, we've seen VR headsets and AR headsets before. it's uh. typically there's screens on the inside and then on the outside there's some sort of shell which has some sensors on the outside that help detect what is in your room, around you and help to see the controllers in your hands. but with this one, there are no controllers at all. they're not making any for it. there aren't going to be any optional accessory, they're not even going to design any controllers. you are controlling this thing entirely with your hands and your eyes and your voice. so you put this headset on and basically all over the headset there are an absolute ton of sensors. you have two main forward-facing cameras, two down downward facing cameras, two more cameras for the sides, two infrared illuminators, a lidar scanner, a true depth camera. these are all to keep track of what's happening around the headset and also to track your hands. in front of your face and then on the inside, there's also a bunch of infrared illuminators and infrared cameras that are purely there, just there to track your eyes. so there's actually a setup process before you even get the headset. you basically measure, you sort of scan your face with the true depth camera on the iPhone and it uses that depth information about your face to give you sort of a custom cut out. this will be a process that you can do in Apple Stores, but basically you get the headset with the custom cut out for your face- if you have glasses, there are some Zeiss lenses. but you finally get the headset out and you put it on and there's some nice meshing on the back, some fabric that stretches and is pretty breathable. it's built extremely well with all this metal and glass and then, once you get it going, the most impressive thing about this headset, the most impressive thing, is the eye tracking. I'm not even kidding this. this eye tracking is sick. so basically, the eye tracking in this headset, as it looks at your eyes and keeps track of where your eyes move around, is the closest thing that I've experienced to like magic, like I don't. I normally don't call Tech things sort of magical or surreal like this, but this was, even for a pre-release product, kind of unbelievable how well it does. anytime you move your eyes around the UI, it would immediately highlight and select exactly what you're looking at, no matter how small the target was or what you're looking at. and then, when you want to select something, all you do is take your fingers, like this, and just touch them together. that's how you click. so you look at something, click, look at something, click so there's actually there's a calibration process. when you first set up the headset, you put it on for the first time, where you basically just look around with your eyes at a bunch of different dots, so it learns your eyes and then, yeah, from that point on, you're just cruising, you're sailing through everything by just looking at things, and it feels like telepathic. you just look at something and select it and that's it. so this is how the whole UI works. pretty much every other headset has the ability to use your hands to select things, but most of them rely on the sensors on the outside to keep track of a set of controllers for maximum accuracy. but this massive array of sensors on the outside of Apple's headset have done an impressively good job of picking up what my hand is doing, kind of no matter where it is. so, like I said, there's sensors all the way around the thing. they're facing forward, but they're facing sideways and facing down, so I can just kind of rest my hand, like wherever, and look at stuff and click. I don't even have to move my head, I can just look at something and just click my fingers. I kind of did it by accident a few times, like I just sort of be sitting there and my fingertips would actually touch and I'd select whatever I was looking at. but pretty quickly you get used to just just this, just just doing this. now there are also some text boxes. occasionally you want to type something and so you can look at the text box, select it and then a keyboard will pop up and you can look at the letters. but also you can just look at a search box field and just start talking and it'll start filling in whatever you're saying, because there's microphones on the headset and there's also something they're calling optic ID, which is basically kind of just the fingerprint ID of the headset, because it's looking at your eyes and everyone's eyes is a different, unique biometric pattern and so you log in just by putting a headset on and it looks at your eyes. so optic ID- this thing knows your eyes really well. so you've probably seen all these weird looking frames where you can see people's eyes through it like this, this super weird thing that I've never seen in any other headset. so what is happening here? well, spoiler alert, it's not actually transparent. it kind of looks like it's a glass transparent thing, but it's not. it appears to be because there's actually an OLED screen facing out. this is what I would call a 2 way pass-through. that's what I'm calling it. see, a normal VR headset we've seen is, of course, completely opaque. usually it's like black plastic or something like that. so, in order to see through to your actual environment without taking the headset off, like for picking up your controllers or walking around a room without hitting a wall, they have a pass-through mode. so it'll turn on a camera on the outside so you can see what's going on around you. and some pass-through modes are better than others. some will do it from a single black and white camera. some will do stereo pass through from two cameras. some will do color pass through. the pass-through on Apple's headset is, again, the best I've ever seen in a headset. it's stereo, it's color, it's sharp, it's real time. it's really good. so then the eyes you see from the outside are actually an OLED display showing what your eyes look like to the cameras inside the headset, so it shows your eyes like this whenever you're using any sort of pass-through mode, and if you can see your environment, it'll show your eyes. so you're not actually like looking at someone's eyes, but it kind of feels like you are kind of creepy a little bit. I don't know, it's the simplest way of explaining it. if they're doing something fully immersive in VR, like watching a movie or playing a game, then it won't show their eyes. it'll show this graphic over their eyes instead. it's a really interesting look. it's a, it's a bold look. I just have this like thought of: like you're, uh, you're- on a airplane and the flight attendant walks up and Taps you- hey, do you want any water? and you just look up and your eyes shine through the headset. it's just a weird thing. I don't think it's smart, but I don't think other headsets are gonna do it, because most of them don't have it in the budget to have a screen facing the outside. but then let's get to the burning question. you've probably already been thinking: what does it actually do? so, okay, I'm sort of I'm separating this into three bulk categories that I made up and I'm kind of proud of here, which are Computing content and connections. now, actually, I should preface this all by saying this is a first gen product, so right now the only apps that show up on the home screen are Apple's apps, just like when the first iPhone came out with no app store. it's just Apple's apps. but the reason this is coming out- or at least getting announced so early, but it's not coming out till next year- is to give this window for developers to start developing their own apps and making cool things for this headset to do. that are way more interesting and way more functional. but it does have a core set of functions. so for computing, I think this is the one that's probably the least likely to be used by most normal people. but it is a pretty direct shot at what meta just did with the quest Pro, the 1500 Quest Pro, so you can use this thing as its own computer, with web browsing, Etc, with these 4K windows in front of you that you can move around and do all kinds of stuff with your hands. now this will be its own OS again. it's not running off your phone or anything, it's running a whole new operating system called Vision OS and it seems pretty similar, pretty similar to iPad OS, just in the fact that you know you're just touching things. in iPad OS and in this headset you look at something and then you touch your fingers together and that's basically just like a normal touch. but I was really impressed with the responsiveness. again, this was better than any headset I've seen. with just your hands, if I wanted to scroll through something like a safari window, I literally, in air, would touch my fingers together and drag the window and it would scroll nearly in real time. I would like throw it around like, toss it, catch it, toss it the other way and start scrolling through things with my finger, resizing Windows, dragging the corners of things, and I was super impressed with that too. now, if you're like me, you might have also had some questions about the sharpness, like: do I really want to wear something like this for a long time to work like it's on a computer? and I think I was also pretty smartly addressed. they use a selective rendering based on the super good eye tracking, so the computing power is basically focusing on sharply rendering the part of the screen that you're actually looking at while saving power on the rest. it's pretty cool and it works so quickly that I did not notice it while using it. and then the part you're looking at is actually very sharp. like I said before, they're super high resolution screens, they're 4K. I don't know if I have a number for refresh rate, but it felt like 120 hertz. and you know I fatigue will eventually become a thing with any headset you strapped to your face. but this would be on the lower level of eye fatigue compared to what I've experienced with some others and then for even more heavy work. this was kind of nuts, but they showed it in the keynote. apparently, if you have a Mac and you want to do Mac OS stuff, you can just, with the headset on, just look at your Mac and it will pick up what you're doing and it'll mirror the max display as one of the 4K windows for you in the headset. and then you can even connect a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth trackpad and start working around like it's an actual Mac, just with a bigger screen, wherever you want at- yeah, ecosystem stuff. so that's Computing. I definitely got to try it. but then of course, there's the- uh, the connection stuff. you got messaging. you can type out messages to people just like as if you were on a Mac, but there's also, impressively, FaceTime now. I don't even know that this is necessarily better than a normal FaceTime, holding your phone or like on a laptop, other than the fact that I guess you don't have to be holding anything but you can have people's windows floating in front of you as you talk to them on FaceTime. but you might also be asking: wait a second. if I'm not holding my phone in front of me, what do other people on FaceTime see? well, the answer is they'll see a 3D rendered model of you that was scanned into the system from your iPhone that syncs up and matches the movements of your face with eye tracking and all the other sensors of the headset. so I I got to try it. it is, it works okay. so it's it's. it's not as good as obviously looking at a person. I just feel like a FaceTime, you're trying to have like a personal connection with the person, and this is obviously more personal than an avatar or like a cartoon of you, but it's just, it feels kind of somewhere in between. it's kind of like a Google project- Starline- which I just did that video about a couple weeks ago. if you haven't already seen that, I'll leave a link with a like button so you can check it out, but it feels sort of in that like uncanny valley, you know, moving 3D model territory instead of looking at an actual person. it's kind of how I picture it. but then, last but not least, of course, content. people are just going to watch content on this thing and I think this is the industry, now that Apple's jumping into it, that is poised to explode, like we've had VR games and VR videos for a long time and apple is now also able to do this. they of course, put their own spin on it and they can use the power and the draw of the Apple brand to get content creators and big motion picture studios and sports leagues and all kinds of creatives to work to make content that looks really good specifically on Apple's headset and in Apple's formats. I can personally save from My Demo: hell, yes, I would watch. I would pay to watch an NBA game Courtside in the VR headset. the quality is good enough and obviously it's not going to be as immersive as feeling the energy from the crowd, but you're not paying Courtside prices. you'd probably pay- is a total guess- 10, 20 bucks to watch an NBA game Courtside or have some subscription to do that. I would totally do that and it would be fun. but even with regular 2D content, like movies, just watching a regular movie- you can totally just sit back, put the headset on, maybe even put some headphones on, and, just like on a plane seat, just watch a movie as if you're in a theater for one, which is pretty sweet, there is that digital crown on the side that actually lets you spin it clockwise to move in more immersion and fully envelop you in the VR environment, or you can turn it counterclockwise to bring in more of your real world environment with pass-through in your peripheral vision- kind of a neat trick. and then there's also this kind of weird feature where you can take 3D photos and videos with the cameras built into the headset itself, and I did not like this one. so there was a demo of like a, a recording from a headset camera of a kid blowing out some candles on a birthday cake, basically, and I got to watch this actual scene in the actual Apple headset. so because there's two cameras like front-facing there, they can record stereoscopic 3D, so you can turn on the recording and in that moment sit down and record a super immersive video and then when you watch it back in the headset, it's like you're reliving this moment in 3D, which can feel kind of cool, but I just I can't get the image of like the dad at the birthday party with the headset on, just recording things like walking around. it just doesn't. it's. what kind of memory is that for the other people around you? you know, like I saw this and I immediately thought back to the, the reasons we all know why Google Glass failed, which is it was ahead of its time. but it's also like they're walking around with a camera on your face and everybody knows that you have a camera on your face. it just wasn't cool, dad. what are you doing? why do you? why are your eyes sticking out through the headset? so all right, the number one question I've gotten after I've actually tried this thing is: is it any good? is this headset any good? and the answer is well yes. some of the parts of this headset that I tried are actually the best I have ever seen in any VR headset by a mile, specifically the eye tracking and the Hand tracking. now, of course, it's going to be up to developers to really make it good, but I think the foundational like how do you use it? part is pretty amazing, but that doesn't mean there aren't any downsides. all right. number one: there was no haptics, of course, because you don't have controllers, you're just doing everything with your hands in the air. there's no way to have any sort of haptic feedback. there was a demo that I did where, like, I stuck my hand out, a wall on the other side of the room opened up and a dinosaur was back there and a butterfly flew out. I held out my hand and the butterfly flew up and landed on my finger. it could track and see all that information in the volumetric. all the computation to make that happen was amazing. but when the butterfly landed and I didn't feel anything, there was that moment of like: oh right, this is a VR headset. but then, number two: this was interesting. this is pretty heavy. this is a pretty heavy VR headset, kind of the same way that, um, airpods max- the Apple's metal headphones are heavier than most plastic headphones. there's a reason why most other VR headsets are just plastic. it's not because that's cheap. it's because it's lightweight. it's fatiguing to have a heavy thing on your head and this is a headset made of metal and glass. it's heavy. now it is also super well built like. there is no arguing that. but I do wonder about using it for longer than the half hour that I did. I wonder if it would be more fatiguing to my head. that's also actually why the battery isn't attached to it. that would be a ton of weight to carry on your head. so they connected the battery instead through a proprietary cable and that actually can sit next to you on the couch or in your back pocket. and that brings us to the other thing: the battery life. two hours, two hour battery life on the headset, which is not that great. it's not that long. now there's a USBC port on the battery bank and you can plug that into the wall for infinite time. but the second you unplug from the wall, yeah, two hours from that pretty hefty battery bank, which is like okay, maybe most people won't be spending a lot of time in the headset, but you did also just show us apple and AD of people like watching a movie in the headset. that's already like most movies are two hours plus, so something we're thinking about. there's just a two hour, but I'm sure people will make bigger external batteries for this thing. but two hours. and then also, I couldn't get a firm answer here on if there are fans inside or not, but I think they're stands, like they're certainly vents for fans anyway. and if you're gaming for long enough or using it for long enough, do those spin up? do they ever get loud? do they ever kill your battery? that's kind of unclear. but then of course, the main thing that everybody's talking about it's expensive. it's 3 500, so is that pricey? yeah, that's very expensive. but this is the thing that is always weird with Apple products: like there is no direct comp. like I always, you always say it's expensive, but like, compared to what? and they, they did this with, uh, the pro display, xdr. they've done this with even airpods Max a little bit. but like there, there are several things that this headset does that no other headset does: the eye tracking, the hand tracking- that's super good. even if an equivalent headset came along today and did all of the same stuff that this does, hardware and software wise, it still wouldn't have face time. it still wouldn't have like looking at a Mac and then the ecosystem allowing the max display to pop up. so this is kind of something that only Apple could pull off. so bottom line. you know, I got to try it. I thought it was extremely impressive, but at the end of the day, this is not a product for the masses. I mean, obviously right, it's three thousand five hundred dollars. it has the word Pro in the name too. but this, this feels like this series zero, like the Apple Watch- Remember When the Apple watch first came out? the series zero, where it's really going to be up to the first gen, the early adopters and the developers, to decide the direction that this thing goes, to decide what people actually want to use it for, and that'll shape the future versions of it that we may eventually get down the road. then maybe someday there's like a, a vision SE, that's like 400 bucks, that the masses will all adopt and it'll be this next Generation hit product. Maybe, but as of right now, this is very much in the sort of early adopter people like me, people like watching this video testing phase to figure it out. so that's the Apple Vision Pro. it's- uh, it's, it's the rich person's toy, and the developers Muse for right now. but we'll see how far this thing goes in the near future. it's coming out next year. it's not that far off. it's not that far away. it's really interesting times. either way, this was also part of a huge entire WWDC keynote. so if you want to watch my recap of the rest of that stuff, ideally get subscribed, because there's going to be a video recap of the biggest announcements of which there are many other things. and also, uh, I'll shout out the waveform podcast. to get subscribed there too, because the next episode, I'll just say it, it's a banger, it's pretty sick. so hit, sub, hit, like, hang out in the comments. that's been it for this one. thanks for watching. catch you guys in the next one. peace."},

"start": 752.88, "duration": 2.12}], "text": "foreign\nthis is the brand new Sony Xperia one\nMark V it's the one five the fifth one\nuh this is a fourteen hundred dollar\npure Enthusiast phone from Sony uh I've\nbeen using it came out a couple weeks\nago actually it was announced a couple\nweeks ago but it's not out yet but I've\nbeen really loving it so far and just\nlike a lot of their other previous\nphones there's some incredible Tech here\nbut I've had to take a step back and\nrealize that these phones are endangered\nspecies for a reason like Sony phones\nwere already a rare breed to start with\nI've talked about this before in past\nvideos where I've reviewed the Sony\nXperia 5 Mark II and the Xperia 1 Mark\nIII and the one mark IV and the pro I\nEtc all these phones and this one are\nloaded with features and manual controls\nand Technology\nbut they also all have like the smallest\nTarget demographic like the narrowest\nband of people who will actually\nappreciate everything that they do and\nthat's fine there's nothing wrong with a\nproduct like that existing but that also\nhas me kind of worried see we lost HTC\nwe lost LG this this is just in the past\ncouple of years uh and YouTube\ncommenters would probably have you\nbelieving that it was just the negative\nvideos about the smartphones that\nsingle-handedly took them down even\nthough there was huge corporations\nbehind them and that's clearly not true\nbut I would like to try something a\nlittle bit different today because I\nactually think Sony right now looks\nalmost exactly like where Porsche the\ncar company used to be so if we're being\ngenerous Sony smartphones today are like\nPorsche cars 20 years ago so Porsche was\ntoiling away making expensive Enthusiast\nsports cars for years and they were sick\nthey were really fun cars but also their\nsales numbers were anemic and the\nbusiness itself was actually in danger\nso the strategy to oversimplify was just\ngive the people what they want crossover\nSUVs are starting to blow up they're\ntaking off in sales and they're becoming\nthe most popular best-selling vehicle so\nthey took a bit of a risk as a sports\ncar company and built a Porsche\ncrossover SUV that was a Porsche Cayenne\nthat thing went on to become their\nbest-selling vehicle ever by a mile and\npropped up the whole rest of the\nbusiness well enough to keep everything\nelse afloat so they could afford to also\nkeep making the expensive and sports\ncars it was kind of sacrilegious at the\ntime for Porsche to make an SUV but if\nyou ask any Porsche fan today they're\nall glad that the Cayenne exists because\nit enables them to keep making the 911s\nand the gt3s and everything else that\nthey love so much so hear me out Sony\ngive the people what they want now\nimportantly what I'm not saying is for\nthem to stop making these super high-end\nEnthusiast phones but what I am saying\nis they need some sort of like Mass\nMarket appealing phone that people like\nme can actually recommend to everyone so\nthat they can afford to keep making\nphones like this so I'm thinking\nsomething in the six to eight hundred\ndollar range which isn't totally foreign\nto them they can do this and it needs to\nkeep of course all the character that\nmakes a Sony phone a Sony phone not just\nanother generic 700 phone but really\nthink hard about this so here's three\nthings I would do or would recommend for\nSony to make a Sony character Mass\nmarket phone the same way that Porsche\nmade a Porsche character mass-market\nvehicle so number one with the phone\nitself you got a smartly slightly cut\ndown those specs so this new Sony Xperia\n1 Mark 5 I've been talking about it has\na 6.5 inch 21x9 120 hertz 4K\nHDR OLED display it's kind of ridiculous\nit's one of the most technically\nimpressive parts of any phone just like\nthe last Sony phone and the one before\nthat it's literally 643 pixels per inch\nit's the sharpest thing you'll see on a\nmobile device Sony is the only company I\nsee right now putting 4K displays in\ntheir smartphones\nand there's a reason for it so for the\nmass market phone\n1080p\nand I know it sounds sacrilegious\nbecause this Tony thing is always a 4K\ndisplay but they did have the Xperia 5\nMark III which is also 1080p display and\nyou keep all the Sony character around\nthe display because it's not just the 4K\nresolution that makes this a Sony thing\nbut there are also one of very few to be\ndoing the tall 21x9 aspect ratio that\nmakes it easier to hold and the flat\npanel with no curves around the edges\nand no hole punch and it's surrounded by\nlarge front-facing speakers because I\ndon't mind a little bit of bezel they\nshould keep all of that now some of you\nmight also be thinking right now about\nthe Xperia 10 series which is Sony's\nline of like more budget oriented\n400-ish dollar phones those phones have\n60hz 1080p displays I think this should\nbe right in this sweet spot in the\nmiddle just do a premium mid-range 120\nhertz 1080P and I'd also like to make it\na bit smaller this is a six and a half\ninch display which like I said is on the\nlarger side and while Sony's doing what\nthey can to make it more reachable with\n21 by nine it's still going to be tough\nfor people to reach the top without some\nhand gymnastics mostly because the\nfingerprint reader power button is here\nand so if you unlock the phone while\nholding it like this it's unlikely that\nyou can also reach the top with your\nthumb so I'm thinking getting it down to\nroughly a six inch phone maybe a little\nless 1080p display with Sony character\naround it all that's really the biggest\nspec to cut down really the only other\nthing you end up missing out on if you\nmake a smaller phone is a slightly\nsmaller battery but then you're going\nfrom a 5 000 milliamp hour battery and a\n4K display to a 1080p display with a 4\n600 milliamp hour battery so then number\ntwo and this is a big one a better\nautomatic camera now it's specifically\nspecifically\nautomatic cameras so what you've\nprobably heard me talk about in the past\nis do not get it twisted these are some\nof the absolute best cameras in any\nsmartphone but they are because they are\nso manually controllable and\ncustomizable that's why the enthusiasts\nlike me love these things and why so\nmany people in that crowd will buy them\nbut it's just a different world being in\nfull auto so these have a lot of\nparallels to shooting with like the Sony\nAlpha cameras and then this Xperia 1\nMark 5 has some interesting new stuff\nthey've moved up to a 52 megapixel\nsensor which is not a number you see\nvery often but that's really just\nbinning down to 12 megapixels with some\nextra room for stabilization and it is a\n1.7 times larger sensor than the last\ngen with some new optimizations\nsurrounding the sensor Tech itself it's\ninsane you see by decoupling the photo\ndiode and transistor from being housed\nin the same space they basically free up\nroom to have a larger photo diode in the\nsame area and that also lets them\nincrease the size and overall\nperformance of the transistor in its own\nlayer all this results in better light\nsensitivity on each sensitive area and\nlarger pixels on their own substrate\nlayers which results in massively lower\nnoise and improved low light sensitivity\nif you know how to use it so what's\nfrustrating about reviewing these Sony\nphones is I can say all that and the\nenthusiasts will appreciate it but I\nstill can't recommend a fourteen hundred\ndollar phone to the masses that still\nhas a slightly confusing slightly subpar\nfull auto camera mode like if you want\nto dig in and navigate your way around\nyou can get incredible footage and\nphotos out of these cameras in the more\nmanual modes but on a Sony phone first\nof all there are three camera apps\nCinema pro video Pro and Photo Pro and\neven in the most basic mode of Photo Pro\nthat launches when you just hit that\nsweet dedicated shutter button it's a\nlittle more complex than most people are\nused to there's just a few extra\nunlabeled buttons there's just a few\nweird quirks like the photo modes are\nhidden under more but also night mode\nand portrait mode are down here at the\nbottom it's also weird that the shutter\nbutton doesn't blink at all when you\ntake a photo I know it's just a tiny\nthing but regular people expect the\nviewfinder to Blink when they take a\npicture because every other smartphone\ndoes and for some reason Sony's doesn't\nit seems unnecessary but this auto mode\nit just has to be simplified even more\nthan it already has of course right\nbehind the dumb down Auto modes is a ton\nof other way more powerful modes all the\nmanual modes all the Sony character is\nstill there but for the masses I promise\nyou they just want to like pull the\nphone out their pocket launch the camera\nreal quick and take a picture of their\nfriend or their kid their pet doing\nsomething silly there's something\nhappened right in front of them they\njust want to take a quick snap and they\nwant that to be the best picture\npossible just that Quick Auto One Shot\nboom and I even get a little bit bummed\nout by the quality of shots from Sony's\nstraight auto mode because I know all\nthe technology that goes into these\ncameras also Sony literally makes all\nthese sensors so they should have the\nbest vertical integration pipeline in\nthe world but yet they still get blown\nout the Water by a pixel or a Samsung\nphone in these basic point-and-shoot\nsituation Sony tends to overexpose a\nlittle bit they don't do HDR scenes as\nwell as the others they were\nconsistently near dead last in the blind\nsmartphone camera test that I ran last\nyear where you all voted on the best\nlooking pictures without knowing which\ncamera took which photo so Sony's\nfull-blown auto mode despite having all\nthis awesome Tech can still be pretty\nrough and fixing that would make a\nmassive difference to making it for the\nmasses so then number three last but not\nleast\ntreat it like a flagship Sony it would\nbe great if you could copy the other's\nhomework a little bit on this one here\nI'm not even going to get into the\nnaming of the phones but you have to put\nout the phone a week maybe two weeks Max\nafter you announce it like that I don't\nknow how else to say it like I know\nthere's a lot that goes into launching a\nphone and of course getting it into\ncarrier stores in certain markets and\ninternational markets and getting\neverything to work but you I think you\nreally need to do as much as possible\nbehind the scenes so that when you\nreveal the phone as soon as that hype\nwave starts to Crest people can buy it\none to two weeks later tops now Sony\nbelieve it or not is making some\nprogress on this it used to be six\nmonths of a gap between announcing the\nphone and it going on sale can you\nimagine that it's like a phone gets\nannounced in April\nand you can't actually buy it until like\nOctober it's absurd but then they got it\ndown to five they got it down to four\nthis phone was announced May 11th but B\nH has it estimated for July 28th that\nwould be still almost three months after\nthe initial unveiling which is better\nthan it used to be but that's still\ntrust me that's enough time for people\nto forget about it and find something\nelse to do with their 1400 bucks so\nSony's got to get this window down to be\nmuch much shorter so to summarize\nthere's clearly nothing wrong with Sony\nmaking these incredibly high-end\nimpressive Enthusiast phones just like\nthere's nothing wrong with Porsche\nmaking their awesome high-end

one, uh, this is a fourteen hundred dollar pure Enthusiast phone from Sony. uh, I've been using it. came out a couple weeks ago actually, it was announced a couple weeks ago but it's not out yet. but I've been really loving it so far and, just like a lot of their other previous phones, there's some incredible Tech here. but I've had to take a step back and realize that these phones are endangered species for a reason. like Sony phones were already a rare breed to start with. I've talked about this before in past videos where I've reviewed the Sony Xperia 5 Mark II and the Xperia 1 Mark III and the one mark IV and the pro I, Etc. all these phones and this one are loaded with features and manual controls and Technology, but they also all have like the smallest Target demographic, like the narrowest band of people who will actually appreciate everything that they do, and that's fine. there's nothing wrong with a product like that existing. but that also has me kind of worried. see, we lost HTC, we lost LG. this this is just in the past couple of years, uh, and YouTube commenters would probably have you believing that it was just the negative videos about the smartphones that single-handedly took them down, even though there was huge corporations behind them, and that's clearly not true. but I would like to try something a little bit different today, because I actually think Sony right now looks almost exactly like where Porsche the car company used to be. so, if we're being generous, Sony smartphones today are like Porsche cars 20 years ago. so Porsche was toiling away making expensive, Enthusiast, sports cars for years and they were sick. they were really fun cars, but also their sales numbers were anemic and the business itself was actually in danger. so the strategy to oversimplify was: just give the people what they want. crossover SUVs are starting to blow up. they're taking off in sales and they're becoming the most popular, best-selling vehicle. so they took a bit of a risk as a sports car company and built a Porsche crossover SUV that was a Porsche Cayenne. that thing went on to become their best-selling vehicle ever by a mile and propped up the whole rest of the business well enough to keep everything else afloat so they could afford to also keep making the expensive and sports cars. it was kind of sacrilegious at the time for Porsche to make an SUV, but if you ask any Porsche fan today, they're all glad that the Cayenne exists because it enables them to keep making the 911s and the gt3s and everything else that they love so much. so hear me out: Sony, give the people what they want. now, importantly, what I'm not saying is for them to stop making these super high-end, Enthusiast phones, but what I am saying is they need some sort of like Mass Market appealing phone that people like me can actually recommend to everyone, so that they can afford to keep making phones like this. so I'm thinking something in the six to eight hundred dollar range which isn't totally foreign to them. they can do this, and it needs to keep, of course, all the character that makes a Sony phone a Sony phone, not just another generic 700 phone. but really think hard about this. so here's three things I would do or would recommend for Sony to make a Sony character Mass market phone, the same way that Porsche made a Porsche character mass-market vehicle. so, number one: with the phone itself, you got a smartly slightly cut down those specs. so this new Sony Xperia 1 Mark 5 I've been talking about it has a 6.5 inch, 21x9, 120 hertz, 4K HDR OLED display. it's kind of ridiculous. it's one of the most technically impressive parts of any phone, just like the last Sony phone and the one before that. it's literally 643 pixels per inch. it's the sharpest thing you'll see on a mobile device. Sony is the only company I see right now putting 4K displays in their smartphones, and there's a reason for it. so for the mass market phone, 1080p- and I know it sounds sacrilegious because this Tony thing is always a 4K display- but they did have the Xperia 5 Mark III, which is also 1080p display, and you keep all the Sony character around the display, because it's not just the 4K resolution that makes this a Sony thing, but there are also- one of very few to be doing- the tall 21x9 aspect ratio that makes it easier to hold, and the flat panel with no curves around the edges and no hole punch, and it's surrounded by large front-facing speakers. because I don't mind a little bit of bezel. they should keep all of that. now, some of you might also be thinking right now about the Xperia 10 series, which is Sony's line of like more budget oriented 400-ish dollar phones. those phones have 60hz 1080p displays. I think this should be right in this sweet spot in the middle. just do a premium mid-range, 120 hertz 1080P, and I'd also like to make it a bit smaller. this is a six and a half inch display, which, like I said, is on the larger side, and while Sony's doing what they can to make it more reachable, with 21 by nine, it's still going to be tough for people to reach the top without some hand gymnastics, mostly because the fingerprint reader power button is here, and so if you unlock the phone while holding it like this, it's unlikely that you can also reach the top with your thumb. so I'm thinking getting it down to roughly a six inch phone, maybe a little less 1080p display with Sony character around it all. that's really the biggest spec to cut down. really, the only other thing you end up missing out on if you make a smaller phone is a slightly smaller battery, but then you're going from a 5 000 milliamp hour battery and a 4K display to a 1080p display with a 4 600 milliamp hour battery. so then number two- and this is a big one- a better automatic camera. now it's specifically, specifically automatic cameras. so what you've probably heard me talk about in the past is: do not get it twisted. these are some of the absolute best cameras in any smartphone, but they are because they are so manually controllable and customizable. that's why the enthusiasts like me love these things and why so many people in that crowd will buy them. but it's just a different world being in full auto. so these have a lot of parallels to shooting with, like the Sony Alpha cameras. and then this Xperia 1 Mark 5 has some interesting new stuff. they've moved up to a 52 megapixel sensor, which is not a number you see very often, but that's really just binning down to 12 megapixels with some extra room for stabilization, and it is a 1.7 times larger sensor than the last gen, with some new optimizations surrounding the sensor Tech itself. it's insane, you see, by decoupling the photo diode and transistor from being housed in the same space, they basically free up room to have a larger photo diode in the same area, and that also lets them increase the size and overall performance of the transistor in its own layer. all this results in better light sensitivity on each sensitive area and larger pixels on their own substrate layers, which results in massively lower noise and improved low light sensitivity, if you know how to use it. so what's frustrating about reviewing these Sony phones is: I can say all that and the enthusiasts will appreciate it, but I still can't recommend a fourteen hundred dollar phone to the masses that still has a slightly confusing, slightly subpar full auto camera mode, like if you want to dig in and navigate your way around. you can get incredible footage and photos out of these cameras in the more manual modes, but on a Sony phone, first of all, there are three camera apps: Cinema pro, video Pro and Photo Pro- and even in the most basic mode of Photo Pro that launches when you just hit that sweet dedicated shutter button. it's a little more complex than most people are used to. there's just a few extra unlabeled buttons. there's just a few weird quirks, like the photo modes are hidden under more, but also night mode and portrait mode are down here at the bottom. it's also weird that the shutter button doesn't blink at all when you take a photo. I know it's just a tiny thing, but regular people expect the viewfinder to Blink when they take a picture because every other smartphone does and for some reason Sony's doesn't. it seems unnecessary. but this auto mode, it just has to be simplified even more than it already has. of course, right behind the dumb down Auto modes is a ton of other way more powerful modes, all the manual modes, all the Sony character is still there. but for the masses, I promise you, they just want to, like, pull the phone out their pocket, launch the camera real quick and take a picture of their friend or their kid, their pet, doing something silly. there's something happened right in front of them. they just want to take a quick snap and they want that to be the best picture possible. just that Quick Auto, One Shot, boom. and I even get a little bit bummed out by the quality of shots from Sony's straight auto mode, because I know all the technology that goes into these cameras. also, Sony literally makes all these sensors, so they should have the best vertical integration pipeline in the world, but yet they still get blown out the Water by a pixel or a Samsung phone. in these basic point-and-shoot situation, Sony tends to overexpose a little bit. they don't do HDR scenes as well as the others. they were consistently near dead last in the blind smartphone camera test that I ran last year, where you all voted on the best looking pictures without knowing which camera took which photo. so Sony's full-blown auto mode, despite having all this awesome Tech, can still be pretty rough, and fixing that would make a massive difference to making it for the masses. so then, number three, last but not least, treat it like a flagship. Sony, it would be great if you could copy the other's homework a little bit on this one. here I'm not even going to get into the naming of the phones, but you have to put out the phone a week, maybe two weeks Max, after you announce it like that- I don't know how else to say it like. I know there's a lot that goes into launching a phone and, of course, getting it into carrier stores in certain markets and international markets and getting everything to work. but you, I think you really need to do as much as possible behind the scenes so that when you reveal the phone, as soon as that hype wave starts to Crest, people can buy it one to two weeks later. tops, now Sony, believe it or not, is making some progress on this. it used to be six months of a gap between announcing the phone and it going on sale. can you imagine that it's like a phone gets announced in April and you can't actually buy it until like October? it's absurd. but then they got it down to five. they got it down to four. this phone was announced May 11th, but B H has it estimated for July 28th. that would be still almost three months after the initial unveiling, which is better than it used to be, but that's still, trust me, that's enough time for people to forget about it and find something else to do with their 1400 bucks. so Sony's got to get this window down to be much, much shorter. so, to summarize, there's clearly nothing wrong with Sony making these incredibly high-end, impressive, Enthusiast phones, just like there's nothing wrong with Porsche making their awesome, high-end, Enthusiast sports cars. but Porsha needed that Cayenne to survive and I think Sony is going to need some type of Mass Appeal. obvious for the masses type phone that still has the character of all the stuff that makes a Sony phone special. I think it'll be a bit smaller version of this. I don't think it gets a 4K screen, I think it's 1080p. it's a much better Auto camera mode, because that's what most people just want in a phone. it's got to come out a day to two weeks after it's announced and maybe change the name, but still keep the design: the headphone jack, the SIM card tray and micro SD card slot that both pop out without needing any ejector tool. yet somehow keep ip68 water resistance- definitely keep that. keep the taller and more reachable aspect ratio and the square sides. and the fast fingerprint reader that's comboed with the power button and the dedicated shutter button: definitely keep that. the flat screen with no hole punch- cut out the stereo front-facing speaker pair all that would be so killer with some fast Android updates. until then, these will continue to be some of the most underrated phones on the planet, but while the rest of the planet, even though they exist, thanks for watching. catch you in the next one. peace [Music]. thank

"foreign\nHD here and welcome to a Hands-On and\nfirst look of a really interesting new\nfolding phone the Moto Razer plus so you\nknow how a lot of these foldable phones\nhave kind of felt like a small bump up\nfrom the previous one they're all kind\nof similar for both the folding and\nflipping phones\nwell this one feels like a big jump\nforward for the first time in a while it\nfeels like we're sort of Leaping into\nthe second generation of these flipping\nphone things and it's pretty obvious why\nso this Razer plus which is the fourth\ngeneration of the folding phone from\nMotorola is going to have a gigantic\nscreen on the outside cover now gigantic\nis of course a relative term but in a\nsmall phone that folds in half and fits\nin your pocket having a 3.6 inch 144\nHertz poled display that goes basically\ncorner to corner all the way around the\nfront and even as pixels around the\ncameras and the Flash cutouts is pretty\ndramatically different from what we had\nbefore now the rest of the phone is\npretty solid too right I can't quite\ncall it a flagship since it doesn't\nreally have the highest end available\nspecs but it's pretty close feels like\nupper you know premium mid-range and the\nretail price is going to be 9.99 when it\nlaunches in a few weeks this summer\nthey've kind of slowly dropped the Retro\nthrowback aesthetic from the first\ngeneration of this thing and they've\ntightened up the edges and modernized\nthe whole thing the huge chin is gone\nand inside it's a Snapdragon 8 plus gen\none eight gigs of RAM 256 gigs of\nstorage and a decent sized 3 800\nmilliamp hour battery with 30 watt\ncharging and 5 watt wireless charging so\nyeah not any sort of crazy world beater\nFlagship specs but still pretty solid I\nI will note that the 3 800 milliamp hour\nbattery is a thousand milliamp hours\ngreater than the previous gen razor this\nthing only had a 2800 milliamp hour\nbattery so that puts it right in line\nwith the current z-flip the four which\nhas a 3700 milliamp hour and then on the\ninside the main folding display is a 6.9\ninch 22 by 9 1080p poled display and\nit's 165 Hertz ltpo display it's not the\nbrightest thing I've ever seen but hey\nfor a folding phone I think it looks\nreally good it's got the hole punch\nselfie camera at the top the bezels are\neven thinner and the crease it's not\nrevolutionary it's about as subtle as\nI've seen in some other folding phones\nwith its redesigned aluminum hinge\nmechanism it definitely disappears when\nyou're looking at the content and just\nusing the phone but none of that is why\nthis feels like a new generation it\nfeels like a new generation of course\nbecause of the giant outside display so\nlet's talk about it this new outside\ndisplay is really interesting for two\nreasons one because it's basically what\nwe're also expecting based on the rumors\nand leaks from what we've seen of\nSamsung's next flip the flip 5. it's\nprobably also coming out later this\nsummer\nbut also too because this it does throw\na wrench in like how you use a phone\nlike this so like I said this is the 3.6\ninch 144hz display that basically covers\nthe entire outside of this phone right\nup to get near the hinge where I assume\nthe digitizer is the two primary cameras\na 12 megapixel primary and the 13\nmegapixel Ultra wide slash macro and the\nFlash are cutouts with even more pixels\naround them and in between them and so\nyou can basically do anything you want\non this outside screen in its resting\nstate it's just a clock of course but\nyou can change between a bunch of\ndifferent clock Styles they all have\nblack backgrounds so they look pretty\nseamless on the OLED you also get some\nbasic notifications at the bottom left\ncorner and the ability to manage those\nnotifications when you swipe down from\nthe top you have a whole bunch of quick\ncontrols things like brightness and\nWi-Fi and a flashlight and whatever\nmedia is currently playing but then when\nyou wake it up and unlock with a swipe\nup from the bottom or a fingerprint\nunlock you basically get this entire\nhome screen with a wallpaper and a bunch\nof pages of these things widgets\nshortcuts Etc now these are limited\npreset Pages they're actually called\npanels and you can turn them on or off\nor rearrange them in the settings but\nthey do have a variety of things there's\na home panel with the clock and the\nweather and shortcuts to other panels\nbut then of course a calendar panel and\na weather panel and a contacts panel and\nyou can put them in whatever order you\nwant there's also a Spotify one\napparently they've worked with Spotify\nto create this perfectly optimized one\nand I do think it looks pretty good but\nalso you can just use whatever app you\nwant on the outside screen there is a\nsettings page that lets you enable\nalmost any app on your phone to work on\nthe outside screen and control the\ncontinuity settings so when you open and\nclose the phone the app stays open which\nis super useful honestly it sounds\npretty great since you can take photos\nand navigate with Google Maps and pay\nwith gpay and do all kinds of convenient\nstuff without even opening the phone\nthat's the whole point of the outside\nscreen but it also goes so much further\nthan that you can make and receive phone\ncalls with the phone still closed you\ncan use a whole scientific calculator on\nthe outside screen there's a whole\nkeyboard for typing out messages if you\nwant to send emails or text messages\nfrom the outside there's even games of\ncourse these are bordering on gimmicky\nbut there's literally games that\nMotorola built to play on this outside\nscreen like this one where you feed the\nmarble to the end of the maze which is\nof course the camera cutout\nlike you can watch YouTube videos on\nthis thing if you want to it's going to\nbe a weird Square aspect ratio with all\nof this but yeah there's basically no\nlimit to what you can do on this outside\ndisplay it's a super screen it can do\nwhatever you want the screen to do\num but\nhear me out I don't actually know if\nthat's what people want because the more\nI think about it just just zoom out a\nlittle bit with me those uh hot dog\nstyle folding phones like the big\nfolding phones those are all\nproductivity monsters you got the screen\non the inside and the outside those are\nfor people who want to do as much as\npossible and fit as big of a screen as\nthey possibly can in their pockets great\nbut then these little flipping phones\nthey've always been smaller and they've\nalways been a little bit more regular\nand I think it's also kind of nice to\nhave a barrier between uh using your\nphone and not using your phone so if\nthere's just something small and there's\na notification you can clear it but I\nwon't get sucked into like scrolling\nthrough Tick Tock endlessly or Instagram\nreels because I will have to open the\nphone for that\nbut now on this one you can get sucked\ninto tick tocks on the outside screen so\nis this a good thing I mean for me yeah\nI mean I I love having tons of\nfunctionality on the outside the more\nthe better and they've even built some\nextra stuff the whole outside screen can\nbe a viewfinder for the camera and\nthere's also this half folded mode that\nyou can use to hold the phone where it\nfeels like an old camcorder from back in\nthe day but the subject can still see\nthemselves there's a lot of cool stuff\nbut yeah I wonder if the customer of a\nflipping phone like this actually has\nthat like super high on their priority\nlist you know something to think about\nactually Motorola literally alongside\nthis phone also announced the new Razer\nso this is the Razer plus we've been\ntalking about with the huge screen for a\nthousand bucks but the Razer will come\nout later this summer and it's also a\nfolding phone but with just the tiny one\nand a half inch postage stamp size\ndisplay on the outside just like from\nthe earliest flipping phones which I\ndon't know just seems to make a lot of\nsense and the rest of the phone will\nhave just slightly lower end specs like\nit's a Snapdragon 7 gen one it's a 144hz\ninternal display instead of 165. it's\n128 gigs of storage instead of 256. it's\na vegan leather back instead of Gorilla\nGlass victis and it's still ip52 water\nresistant but they didn't tell us the\nprice of this phone so I'm guessing just\nbased on context\nand knowing that it's probably going to\nbe meaningfully cheaper for this new\nphone to

revolutionary, it's about as subtle as I've seen in some other folding phones, with its redesigned aluminum hinge mechanism. it definitely disappears when you're looking at the content and just using the phone, but none of that is why this feels like a new generation. it feels like a new generation, of course, because of the giant outside display, so let's talk about it. this new outside display is really interesting for two reasons. one, because it's basically what we're also expecting, based on the rumors and leaks from what we've seen of Samsung's next flip, the flip 5.. it's probably also coming out later this summer. but also, too, because this it does throw a wrench in, like how you use a phone like this. so, like I said, this is the 3.6 inch 144hz display that basically covers the entire outside of this phone, right up to get near the hinge, where I assume the digitizer is. the two primary cameras- a 12 megapixel primary and the 13 megapixel Ultra wide slash macro- and the Flash are cutouts with even more pixels around them and in between them, and so you can basically do anything you want on this outside screen. in its resting state, it's just a clock, of course, but you can change between a bunch of different clock Styles. they all have black backgrounds, so they look pretty seamless. on the OLED, you also get some basic notifications at the bottom left corner and the ability to manage those notifications. when you swipe down from the top, you have a whole bunch of quick controls, things like brightness and Wi-Fi and a flashlight and whatever media is currently playing. but then when you wake it up and unlock with a swipe up from the bottom or a fingerprint unlock- you basically get this entire home screen with a wallpaper and a bunch of pages of these things- widgets, shortcuts, Etc. now, these are limited preset Pages. they're actually called panels and you can turn them on or off or rearrange them in the settings, but they do have a variety of things. there's a home panel with the clock and the weather and shortcuts to other panels, but then, of course, a calendar panel and a weather panel and a contacts panel and you can put them in whatever order you want. there's also a Spotify one. apparently they've worked with Spotify to create this perfectly optimized one and I do think it looks pretty good. but also you can just use whatever app you want on the outside screen. there is a settings page that lets you enable almost any app on your phone to work on the outside screen and control the continuity settings. so when you open and close the phone, the app stays open, which is super useful. honestly, it sounds pretty great, since you can take photos and navigate with Google Maps and pay with gpay and do all kinds of convenient stuff without even opening the phone. that's the whole point of the outside screen, but it also goes so much further than that. you can make and receive phone calls with the phone still closed. you can use a whole scientific calculator on the outside screen. there's a whole keyboard for typing out messages if you want to send emails or text messages from the outside. there's even games. of course, these are bordering on gimmicky, but there's literally games that Motorola built to play on this outside screen, like this one where you feed the marble to the end of the maze, which is, of course, the camera cutout. like you can watch YouTube videos on this thing if you want to. it's going to be a weird Square aspect ratio with all of this, but yeah, there's basically no limit to what you can do on this outside display. it's a super screen. it can do whatever you want the screen to do. um, but hear me out, I don't actually know if that's what people want, because the more I think about it, just just zoom out a little bit with me. those uh hot dog style folding phones, like the big folding phones, those are all productivity monsters. you got the screen on the inside and the outside. those are for people who want to do as much as possible and fit as big of a screen as they possibly can in their pockets- great. but then these little flipping phones. they've always been smaller and they've always been a little bit more regular, and I think it's also kind of nice to have a barrier between, uh, using your phone and not using your phone. so if there's just something small and there's a notification, you can clear it. but I won't get sucked into like scrolling through Tick Tock endlessly or Instagram reels, because I will have to open the phone for that. but now on this one, you can get sucked into tick tocks on the outside screen. so is this a good thing? I mean for me? yeah, I mean I. I love having tons of functionality on the outside, the more the better. and they've even built some extra stuff. the whole outside screen can be a viewfinder for the camera and there's also this half folded mode that you can use to hold the phone where it feels like an old camcorder from back in the day, but the subject can still see themselves. there's a lot of cool stuff, but, yeah, I wonder if the customer of a flipping phone like this actually has that like super high on their priority list. you know something to think about. actually, Motorola, literally alongside this phone, also announced the new Razer. so this is the Razer plus we've been talking about, with the huge screen for a thousand bucks. but the Razer will come out later this summer and it's also a folding phone, but with just the tiny one and a half inch postage stamp size display on the outside, just like from the earliest flipping phones, which I don't know, just seems to make a lot of sense. and the rest of the phone will have just slightly lower end specs, like it's a Snapdragon 7 gen one, it's a 144hz internal display instead of 165.. it's 128 gigs of storage instead of 256.. it's a vegan leather back instead of Gorilla Glass victis and it's still ip52 water resistant. but they didn't tell us the price of this phone, so I'm guessing just based on context and knowing that it's probably going to be meaningfully cheaper for this new phone to exist. this might be like a 599 to 7.99 brand new folding phone, and that's also really interesting. plus, also because it doesn't have the huge outside screen, it has room for a larger battery- 4 200 milliamp hours- and a larger primary camera- 64 megapixel camera. so a little lighter on the wallet, a little bit more space for other things- kind of interesting. also, speaking of wallets, this one's a little bit lighter in your pocket too. you can get it at shopwhdcom. but that's it. let me know what you think of the giant outside screen on The Flipping phone. is it truly second gen? is this where we're going with them all, or is this kind of Overkill? I'll hang out in the comments for this one. I'm really curious what you guys think. either way, thanks for watching. catch you later. peace, foreign."}, {"title": "iPad Killer or Clone?", "description": "OnePlus Pad\n\nMKBHD Merch:

a\nfull video please make a full video on\nthis please elaborate on this so now\nthat's what I'm doing so I really get to\nexplain what they've done see tablets\nhaven't really changed much over the\npast couple years feels like we've kind\nof settled if you will into this sort of\nhierarchy where especially in the US\niPads are so popular that it's basically\njust iPads and everything else and I've\neven had conversations recently with\nsome friends about this which is just\nlike they straight up won't switch from\nthe iPad like no matter how good of a\ncompetitor comes up it can be amazing\nHardware it can be the best screen the\nbest battery in the world it's an\namazing tablet\nbut it still wouldn't be an iPad which\nis the iMessage and the FaceTime and all\nthe things that plug into the ecosystem\nof iPad and apple world so making an\nAndroid tablet that can actually take\nusers from the iPad is clearly an uphill\nbattle but hey if you're gonna try you\nmight as well have some strategy to it\nand so OnePlus has three so strategy\nnumber one copying the iPad so look just\nto be clear I understand there's only so\nmany ways to make a rectangular computer\nthere's only so many ways to make a\ntablet uh and I actually don't mind when\nproducts copy each other as long as they\ncopy the good stuff\nthat being said yeah they've ripped some\nstuff straight from the iPad now it does\nhave its own unique Hardware aesthetic\nyou got to give them that it's a\ndifferent shape and a different color\nand of course it's a different layout\nwith a bunch of OnePlus and Android\nfeatures that really suggest more\nholding it in landscape unlike the iPads\nwhich feel a bit more interchangeable\nbut they weren't shy about some things\nlike this pencil this is the apple\npencil and this is the new OnePlus\npencil same shape same size same\npressure sensitive tip which is nice\nsame single flat side which prevents it\nfrom Rolling away on a table which is\nsmart but then same slapping onto the\nside of a tablet with magnets and\ncharging it by inductive wireless\ncharging so you don't lose it it's\nconvenient it even has the same little\nanimation to show you when you've paired\nit and how much battery percentage you\nhave there are probably other ways to do\nthis but you know the result is just a\nvery familiar experience with a nice\nfinely controlled pressure sensitive\npointing device for navigating around\nand swiping and even typing and of\ncourse all the drawing and note taking\nyou possibly want they've also made a\nmagnetic keyboard accessory with a\ntrackpad that can connects to the tablet\nwith magnets and these pins and turns it\ninto a whole lappable Android 11 inch\nlaptop alternative it might not\ncompletely float the tablet above the\nkeyboard like the heavier less lappable\none from Apple but it does use basically\nthe exact same cursor mechanism as the\niPad where you can swipe around with\nthis dark circle and then it snaps onto\ndifferent touch targets As you move near\nthem again a pretty great thing to copy\nit's got quad speakers in the same four\nspots as the iPad Pro it's even got this\nUltra wide camera at the front that has\na software feature that can move around\nas you walk around and keep you in the\ncenter of the frame it's not called\nCenter Stage though it's called\nLimelight the point is there's a ton of\nstuff here where if you're going to take\npeople away from the iPad you gotta at\nleast make them feel at home so then\nstrategy number two undercutting the\niPad this one's pretty simple the iPad\nline is already pretty expensive so\nprobably the most compelling thing you\ncan do to get someone to consider an\nalternative is to be cheaper than the\niPad so iPad Air I think that's a pretty\ngood comp iPad Air starts right now with\nthe newest one at 5.99 and that's the 64\ngig version this tablet as we mentioned\npretty fairly priced 479 and that's 128\ngig so you can see it's a pretty good\nstart but\nyou have to be careful because in order\nto get to that price you have to trim\njust the right set of things that people\nhopefully don't notice too much so this\ntablet is running a mediatek demensity\n9000 chip which benchmarks similar to\nthe Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 which is\nabout 50 beneath the more expensive\nFlagship Snapdragon 8 gen 2. honestly\nmost of the time not noticeable but if\nyou are going to ask it some more\ndemanding things especially like gaming\nthen you will feel that this is not the\nhighest end chip there is also no\nfingerprint reader which is fine but\nthere's also no extra infrared or depth\nsensors it's just straight up facial\nrecognition with the standard RGB selfie\ncamera and for some reason my face has\nto be really close to it to unlock it's\njust picky enough to get slightly\nannoying sometimes and then this display\ndoesn't quite get as bright it maxes out\nat 500 nits so it limits your outdoor\nusability for sure and then this\nkeyboard case which is optional it's\nactually noticeably cheaper than Apples\ntoo it's actually 149 so it's literally\nhalf the price of the magic keyboard but\nalso it's not back lit it doesn't float\nthe tablet or anything it's also less\npremium feeling material so it's more in\nline with the smart folio case which is\nstill 179 but really the most\ninteresting strategy strategy number\nthree is one-upping the iPad there are\nsome things they've done with this\ntablet that are objectively better than\nany iPad okay so here we go first of all\nthis is an 11.5 inch display with a\nunique slightly tall seven by five\naspect ratio and slightly thinner bezels\non the iPad but you know what's straight\nup better than any iPad it's 144 Hertz\nrefresh rate granted that's only\nslightly higher than 120 hertz iPad Pro\nbut for 479 I mean you're more in line\nwith the 60 hertz iPad Air and I'm a\nsucker for a high refresh rate display\nand I do notice the difference in a few\nkey places like scrolling around\nbrowsing in Chrome and drawing with the\npen but more on that in a second the\nultra wide front facing camera is on the\nlandscape bezel that's also better than\nalmost every iPad except for the newest\ncheap one so anytime you're on a video\ncall you actually sit in the middle of\nthe frame not kind of awkwardly off to\none side it also is an objectively\nbetter battery than any iPad this is a 9\n500 10 milliamp hour battery that's iPad\nPro sized and combined with the chip has\nRock Solid battery life and very good\nstandby time and it charges much faster\nthan any iPad it's got 67 watt supervook\ncharging so most of the tablet using\nworld is going to be used to the iPad's\nkind of slow 30 watts of charging this\none can charge from zero to 100 in an\nhour and a half with the charger that's\nincluded in the box and then there's\nalso this whole special features section\nin the settings where they've tucked\nthese nice clever little enhancements\nmostly to do with the multitasking\nexperience so I'm not even going to\nremind you of the disaster that is stage\nmanager on the iPad that's still kind of\nrough but on the OnePlus pad you can do\nthings like drag two fingers down from\nthe middle of the screen to slice your\napp in half and initiate split screen\nmultitasking with apps that support it\nand then there's three different window\nsizes that it supports and you can\nswitch those around there's also a smart\nside bar that kind of slides out from\nthe top right where it's this hidden\ndock so you can put your favorite apps\nin there or some quick shortcuts to grab\nwhatever you want or just open up the\nlist of all your apps again so lots of\ngood stuff in here right even they've\neven got some little ecosystem stuff\ngoing on since OnePlus makes phones you\ncan do data sharing with another OnePlus\nphone super easily there's a lot\nbut\nthis is still an Android tablet which\nmeans a lot of things it means of course\nthat there is no FaceTime iMessage all\nthe ecosystem stuff that comes that\nApple people like\nobviously\nbut that also means the app situation is\nstill not what you want it to be like\nwhen I say apps that support it with\nmultitasking that's a pretty small list\nlike there's just very few good\nwell-optimized Android tablet apps even\ntoday in 2023\nit also means that the 144hz capable\ndisplay is rarely actually uh refreshing\nat 144hz it's often at 120 hertz or even\n60 hertz depending on the app support\nagain uh and that sort of means you only\nreally get the extra stuff when you're\nscrolling around the UI or web browsing\nor in the settings app basically and not\nwhile gaming it also means the cameras\nare meh so you see the the camera is\nsort of in this unique layout in the\nmiddle it's a 13 megapixel camera on the\nback but the photos it takes are pretty\nmid not that a tablet is like some\nphotography machine it's mostly for\nvideo calls but even this is pretty\ngrainy it has this like splotching even\nin a well-lit environment not great and\nthen for the arguably even more\nimportant selfie camera it's it's mostly\nfor video calls and so it should look\npretty decent this is perfect lighting\nand even in these dark shadows you can\nsee some weird noise artifacts and\nsplotching and and this over here it\nit's 1080P and it's it's fine it's\nprobably fine but in Limelight mode when\nit's doing the ultra wide and hunting\naround it looks worse than this too and\nit also means that Android 14 is on the\nhorizon so that will probably improve a\nlot of the multitasking stuff we just\nsaw but this one's going to launch with\nAndroid 13. so if you get one it'll have\nAndroid 13 and never buy a product based\non potential future software updates so\nas of right now it's an Android 13\ntablet so OnePlus has made a good tablet\nfor a good price I think a lot of people\nconsider this a bargain f479 for the 128\ngigs but because of this data tablets it\nfeels like they're up against some\nimpossible task like this is the same\nthing that happened to Samsung's Ultra\ntablet remember the video I made on the\nultra the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra tried\nsomething super super high end and\nhonestly in the hardware and design\ndepartment they really beat the iPad in\na lot of ways they made an incredible\npiece but same question where is it now\nI think the same place as this\nsome people are going to buy it and\nthey're going to be pretty happy with it\nand those people knew exactly what they\nwere getting into\nand it's a tough task taking tablet\nbuyers from the iPad\nthanks for watching\ncatch you guys in the next one peace\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]\n", "punctuated_text": "so OnePlus made a tablet and I made a quick short explaining it and immediately there are a bunch of comments like: oh please, this is worth a full video, please make a full video on this, please

to get to that price you have to trim just the right set of things that people hopefully don't notice too much. so this tablet is running a mediatek demensity 9000 chip, which benchmarks similar to

material, so it's more in line with the smart folio case, which is still 179. but really the most interesting strategy, strategy number three- is one-upping the iPad. there are some things they've done with this tablet that are objectively better than any iPad. okay, so here we go. first of all, this is an 11.5 inch display with a unique, slightly tall seven by five aspect ratio and slightly thinner bezels on the iPad. but you know what's, straight up, better than any iPad. it's 144 Hertz refresh rate. granted, that's only slightly higher than 120 hertz iPad Pro, but for 479, I mean, you're more in line with the 60 hertz iPad Air and I'm a sucker for a high refresh rate display. and I do notice the difference in a few key places like scrolling around, browsing in Chrome and

you're on a video call you actually sit in the middle of the frame, not kind of awkwardly off to one side. it also is an objectively better battery than any iPad. this is a 9 500- 10 milliamp hour battery. that's iPad Pro sized and, combined with the chip, has Rock Solid battery life and very good standby time, and it charges much faster than any iPad. it's got 67 watt supervook charging, so most of the tablet using world is going to be used to the iPad's kind of slow 30 watts of charging. this one can charge from zero to 100 in an hour and a half with the charger that's included in the

smart side bar that kind of slides out from the top right, where it's this hidden dock, so you can put your favorite apps in there or some quick shortcuts to grab whatever you want, or just open up the list of all your apps again. so lots of good stuff in here, right, even. they've even got some little ecosystem stuff going on. since OnePlus makes phones, you can do data sharing with another OnePlus phone super easily. there's a lot, but this is still an Android tablet, which means a lot of things. it means, of course, that there is no FaceTime, iMessage, all the ecosystem stuff that comes that Apple people like, obviously. but that also means the app situation is still not what you want it to be like. when I say apps that support it with multitasking, that's a pretty small list, like there's just very few good, well-optimized Android tablet apps even today, in 2023. it also means that the 144hz capable display is rarely actually, uh, refreshing at 144hz. it's often at 120 hertz or even 60 hertz, depending on the app support again, uh, and that sort of means you only really get the extra stuff when you're scrolling around the UI or web browsing or in the settings app, basically, and not while gaming. it also means the cameras are meh. so you see the. the camera is sort of in this unique layout in the middle. it's a 13 megapixel camera on the back, but the photos it takes are pretty mid. not that a tablet is like some photography machine. it's mostly for video calls, but even this is pretty grainy. it has this like splotching, even in a well-lit environment- not great. and then for the arguably even more important selfie camera, it's it's mostly for video calls and so it should look pretty decent. this is perfect lighting and even in these dark shadows you can see some weird noise artifacts and splotching. and- and this over here- it it's 1080P and it's it's fine. it's probably fine, but in Limelight mode, when it's doing the ultra wide and hunting around, it looks worse than this too. and it also means that Android 14 is on the horizon, so that will probably improve a lot of the multitasking stuff we just saw, but this one's going to launch with Android 13.. so if you get one, it'll have Android 13 and never buy a product based on potential future software updates. so as of right now it's an Android 13 tablet, so OnePlus has made a good tablet for a good price. I think a lot of people consider this a bargain- f479 for the 128 gigs- but because of this data tablets, it feels like they're up against some impossible task. like this is the same thing that happened to Samsung's Ultra tablet. remember the video I made on the ultra. the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra tried something super, super high end and, honestly, in the hardware and design department they really beat the iPad in a lot of ways. they made an incredible piece. but same question: where is it now? I think the same place as this. some people are going to buy it and they're going to be pretty happy with it, and those people knew exactly what they were getting into, and it's a tough task taking tablet buyers from the iPad. thanks for watching. catch you guys in the next one. peace [Music]. foreign [Music]."}, {"title": "I Tried a Secret Google Project!", "description": "An exclusive first

called\nGoogle projects Starline you might have\nheard of it might have not but Google\nhas showed a few video examples of this\nlive super immersive like 3D video\ncalling Booth where you sit down in\nfront of it and on the other side\nsomeone else sits down and through the\npower of the internet it looks like an\nextremely realistic version of them is\nactually in front of you it's not just a\nnormal video call but it's not a\nhologram it's just it's something\ndifferent either way we got the first\nlook at it at Google I O A couple of\nyears ago they showed this clip in the\nkeynote and nobody got to record it\nnobody even got to try it but now\nthey're back with a better looking more\ncompact more simplified version\nand I got to try it and record it now\njust as a warning this first clip it\ndoesn't actually do it justice because\nthe effect does not translate very well\non camera we'll get to that but I was\nlucky enough to get my first reaction to\nthis my actual first time seeing it on\ncamera\nall right let's\nsee\nproject start line\noh wow oh hey how are you great okay\nwelcome to Starline\nthank you this is right yeah it's a lot\nmore\nyeah you and I just saw each other right\noutside but we're in two different rooms\nand we want to make it feel like we left\nthat space and we came back together in\nuh virtual space it feels like we're\ncompletely in the same spot it really\nlooks like I can actually uh it looks\nlike you could drop something on this\ntable right here yeah yeah I've got a\nlittle apple over here so let me show\nyou that too so you know you and I are\nin the same room do you want me to pass\nthis over into your space too it looks\nlike you can do it thank you\nwe're meant to feel like this room is\njust one room instead of two separate\nlocations it could be anywhere in the\nworld so this is uh something we think\nis the glimpse of what communication\ncould look like in the next few years\nthat's incredible okay yeah I gotta\nlearn more about this okay so what\nexactly is happening here so I'm sitting\nin front of the new Starline Booth is\nwhat I call it now the first star line\nthey ever made was much bigger they had\nthese like full room setups essentially\nwith a bench and computers the display\nbut also a bunch of cameras and depth\nsensors placed around you this new one\nfeels actually much more refined it\nlooks much simpler and it kind of feels\nlike a reasonable product it's a 65-inch\ndisplay on a stand with a smaller\nbarrier over the bottom bezel and then\nthere are actually some lights on the\nback that point at the wall behind the\ndisplay that serve as a key light for me\nthe person on the call and then there\nare no more depth sensors it's just a\ntidy array of color cameras and micro\nphones and speakers so that's at the top\nthe left and the right and they use AI\nto create a depth map of me and the room\nI'm in and then the magic of this is\ntwofold It's the display and the\nComputing happening so the display the\npart giving you the actually impressive\nimmersive 3D depth effect but then also\nall the Computing happening to turn me\nthe person on the video call and the\nperson on the other side into this\nrealistic 3D model just with the camera\ninformation that you can actually look\naround with head tracking now clearly\nthis doesn't translate well on camera\nwhich is why Google has understandably\nbeen super protective over anyone trying\nit even or or getting any photos or\nvideos of it because it just won't look\nright but I was able to convince Google\nto let me try something you see\nbasically once you first sit down in the\nproject Starline Booth this system has\nto identify where your face is and then\nyou can move around and look at stuff\nwith head and body tracking and of\ncourse that's not going to work if you\njust put a camera in there but if you do\nshow it a face and a camera at the same\ntime like say maybe a cardboard face\nwhere you can stick a camera lens\nsomehow through that cardboard face\nthen it would track and you could ah see\nwhat I'm talking about check this out\nso what you're seeing right now is as if\nyou were on a video call with me in the\nnewest version of Google Starline this\nis the first time anyone outside of\nGoogle has seen the sort of\nvisualization which is super cool so it\nfeel pretty reasonable right now right I\ncan hold up an object you can see the\ncolors and the shapes and the lighting\nand textures on it and this is all\ninformation compiled from the array of\ncameras around me and the depth\ninformation comes from these regular\ncameras and that's all quite cool\nbut as you start moving around\nthat's when it starts getting a little\nmore interesting because I can hold\nthings out and you start to create this\nParallax effect with the head tracking\nwhere you can start to literally look\naround and inspect the object and look\nunderneath things as if you're literally\nin the room with me it's super\nconvincing to the actual eye when you\nsee it on this screen even the\nbackground behind me is not real it's\nbeing composited in but I'm casting a\nshadow on it and that's being rendered\nin real time too it's a lot we can even\nflip a switch to show a sort of a\ntopographical map of specifically the\ndepth information coming from these\ncameras so again no depth cameras\nspecifically being used here but the\narray of color cameras has all this\ndepth information being mapped and\nthat's what all the information from the\ncolor cameras is being sort of projected\nonto there's a lot of processing\nHappening Here\nso it all comes together to form this\nreally impressive\nreal-time I mean I use the word\nimmersion very lightly usually but I\nwill I want to stress that it's very\nimmersive when you actually get to use\nit so hopefully this helps you visualize\nso that is pretty cool but even that\ndoesn't translate perfectly because the\nfeeling of depth actually comes from the\ndistance between your eyes so a camera\nlens is one eye but if you've ever tried\nto catch something with one eye closed\nyou know that humans perceive depth by\nthe difference between what you see with\nyour left eye and what you see with your\nright eye your brain stitches them\ntogether and figures out depth that way\nso even that demo doesn't quite get the\nfull realisticness of what I saw on\ncamera but it's pretty close the lights\nwill display in Project Starline is\nliterally showing a different image to\nmy left eye and to my right eye so\ntaking advantage of that biological fact\nand then letting me actually compute\ndepth on the Fly while doing all the\nhead tracking in real time it's actually\nkind of crazy like if you've ever seen\n3D glasses you know how when you go see\na 3D movie like one of the eyes is blue\none of the eyes is red that's literally\nbecause your left eye will see something\nmap for that and you're right I will see\nsomething that for that and that's how\nit creates the depth effect\nbut this is way better than a 3D movie\nit's so much smoother and the head\ntracking and everything that goes with\nit and it's it's so good but then the\ncraziest part the the most impressive\npart is the Computing that's happening\nwhich is rendering the people using\nStarline in real time into these 3D\nmodels so this is not like the metaverse\nthing or the VR headset tracks face\nmovement and then you can have a eye\ncontact face-to-face conversation with\nsomeone's Cartoon Avatar but no no this\nis this is taking the actual Imaging the\nlighting the the way you actually look\nwhat you're actually wearing and\nrendering that out in real time in 3D\nspace and making it look like I'm\ntalking to them through a window it's\nkind of amazing the eye contact is so\none-to-one real looking and it really\njust comes from the fact that I'm\nsitting here looking forward and the\nperson on the other side is also looking\nforward and so we're actually looking\ninto each other's eyes so anyway yeah it\nit is the point is it's super realistic\nI promise you when I was when I first\ndid my demo the first time I ever saw it\neven knowing that it's 3D I still felt\nlike I could reach out and like high\nfive him or like fist bump him he held\nthat Apple out actually and to my eyes\nit looked like he could just drop the\napple he was holding right on the table\nin front of me which of course meant\nthat I looked stupid from this angle\nbecause I'm just reaching out at nothing\nbut we got a bunch of reactions from\nsome other Studio team members who got\nto join me for this demo I'll link a\nvideo that has some of their reactions\nbelow we should definitely check that\nout so it was really only the like\nslight glitching a little bit of edges\nand fading and stuff like that that kept\nout of uncanny valley territory like\nobviously the eye contact is one thing\nand the 3d effect even it had spatial\naudio so if I leaned over here it would\nsound like more audio came into one of\nyour ears and that was responsive but\nyou know things like in between the\nfingers or like the edges of certain\nFabrics or my hair especially some of\nthat stuff could kind of break it a\nlittle bit and you could tell but\nhonestly I wasn't thinking about that at\nall so you might be thinking kind of the\nsame thing I was after I finished this\ndemo which is\nokay this is super cool but what is this\nfor like what is this sort of a tech\ndemo actually useful for and the answer\nis\nwe don't really know yet so at this\npoint in time Google has worked with a\nfew companies Salesforce wework and\nT-Mobile are some examples who are\nliterally using some of these booths for\nmeetings basically I guess theoretically\nthat's better than a zoom call although\nit still has its limitations like the\nface tracking can only work with one\nperson at a time which means only one\nperson can be in the booth at a time to\nget their realistic depth effect so\nadding another person doesn't work I\nthink the question will be closer to\nbeing answered when the tech gets even\nbetter like we it's already gone from\nthe size of a room to the size of like\nan easel it could just be the size of a\nTV with a backpack on it but this will\nget more realistic cheaper simpler and\njust better but you know here's the\nthing I actually don't know that regular\npeople\nwill actually want this like hear me out\nif I know anything about bleeding edge\nTech which I've tried a lot of it's that\nregular people the masses are not very\nfast to pay extra for higher Fidelity\nlike better quality so the the cutoff\nfor acceptable quality is surprisingly\nlow for the masses like think about it\naudio quality I don't know streaming on\nSpotify over Bluetooth seems to be good\nenough for most people airpods are the\nmost popular headphones in the world you\nthink about cameras and how smartphone\ncameras are basically good enough for 99\nof the\ntaking pictures of your kids you know so\nconvenience is King that like that's why\nright now FaceTime and zoom\nare it's just a square of a flat low-res\nvideo feed on a screen that's fine it's\nfine for most people when you turn it\nall the way up to project Starline which\nis like this incredibly realistic like\nyou can see micro expressions and\ntextures and feel like you're in the\nroom with the person that's over on one\nside here and FaceTime and zoom are on\nthe other side here and this is where\nthe masses live and this is like\nbusinesses you know getting a booth so\nthey don't have to fly people out for\nlots of meetings overseas but it's still\ntoo expensive and too difficult to get\nto for most people but that's just for\nnow that's just for this version now I'm\nreally looking forward to keeping an eye\non how this Tech evolves from Google and\neven from others who are working on this\nwhole 3D light field display technology\nstuff we've actually seen some\ninteresting stuff before I actually\ntried an Asus laptop not too many weeks\nago that does the same thing it renders\na unique image for each of your eyes and\ndoes head tracking for an incredibly\nrealistic 3d effect but of course for\nthat you have to look at a certain file\nthat was built in a certain model and\nwork with certain software this was like\nrendering real people and just having a\nconversation it's crazy it's crazy\nI'm gonna thank you for Google for\nletting us see this and I'm gonna\nhopefully be able to try future versions\nwhen they get finished because this is\nwild let me know what you guys think\nthanks for watching\ncatch you in the next one peace\n[Music]\n", "punctuated_text": "okay, this might be the most impressive Tech demo I've ever seen. it's also one of the hardest to explain on video, but I'm gonna try. so there's a thing called Google projects Starline. you might have heard of it, might have not, but Google has showed a few video examples of this live super immersive, like 3D video calling Booth, where you sit down in front of it and on the other side someone else sits down and, through the power of the internet, it looks like an extremely realistic version of them is actually in front of you. it's not just a normal video call, but it's not a hologram, it's just. it's something different. either way, we got the first look at it at Google I O A couple of years ago. they showed this clip in the keynote and nobody got to record it. nobody even got to try it. but now they're back with a better looking, more compact, more simplified version and I got to try it and record it now, just as a warning, this first clip: it doesn't actually do it justice because the effect does not translate very well on camera. we'll get to that, but I was lucky enough to get my first reaction to this, my actual first time seeing it on camera. all right, let's see project start line. oh wow, oh, hey, how are you great? okay, welcome to Starline. thank you, this is right. yeah, it's a lot more. yeah, you and I just saw each other right outside, but we're in two different rooms and we want to make it feel like we left that space and we came back together in, uh, virtual space. it feels like we're completely in the same spot. it really looks like I can actually uh, it looks like you could drop something on this table right here, yeah, yeah, I've got a little apple over here, so let me show you that too. so you know, you and I are in the same room. do you want me to pass this over into your space too? it looks like you can do it. thank you. we're meant to feel like this room is just one room instead of two separate locations. it could be anywhere in the world. so this is, uh, something we think is the glimpse of what communication could look like in the next few years. that's incredible, okay, yeah, I gotta learn more about this, okay, so what exactly is happening here? so I'm sitting in front of the new Starline- Booth is what I call it now. the first star line they ever made was much bigger. they had these like full room setups, essentially with a bench and computers, the display, but also a bunch of cameras and depth sensors placed around you. this new one feels actually much more refined, it looks much simpler and it kind of feels like a reasonable product. it's a 65-inch display on a stand with a smaller barrier over the bottom bezel, and then there are actually some lights on the back that point at the wall behind the display that serve as a key light for me, the person on the call. and then there are no more depth sensors, it's just a tidy array of color cameras and micro phones and speakers. so that's at the top, the left and the right, and they use AI to create a depth map of me and the room I'm in. and then the magic of this is twofold: It's the display and the Computing happening. so the display- the part giving you the actually impressive immersive 3D depth effect, but then also all the Computing happening to turn me, the person on the video call, and the person on the other side into this realistic 3D model, just with the camera information that you can actually look around with head tracking. now, clearly, this doesn't translate well on camera, which is why Google has understandably been super protective over anyone trying it, even or or getting any photos or videos of it, because it just won't look right. but I was able to convince Google to let me try something. you see, basically, once you first sit down in the project Starline Booth, this system has to identify where your face is and then you can move around and look at stuff with head and body tracking. and of course, that's not going to work if you just put a camera in there. but if you do show it a face and a camera at the same time- like, say, maybe, a cardboard face where you can stick a camera lens somehow through that cardboard face, then it would track and you could- ah, see what I'm talking about, check this out. so what you're seeing right now is as if you were on a video call with me in the newest version of Google Starline. this is the first time anyone outside of Google has seen the sort of visualization, which is super cool, so it feel pretty reasonable right now. right, I can hold up an object, you can see the colors and the shapes and the lighting and textures on it, and this is all information compiled from the array of cameras around me and the depth information comes from these regular cameras and that's all quite cool. but as you start moving around, that's when it starts getting a little more interesting, because I can hold things out and you start to create this Parallax effect with the head tracking, where you can start to literally look around and inspect the object and look underneath things as if you're literally in the room with me. it's super convincing to the actual eye when you see it on this screen. even the background behind me is not real. it's being composited in but I'm casting a shadow on it and that's being rendered in real time too. it's a lot. we can even flip a switch to show a sort of a topographical map of specifically the depth information coming from these cameras. so again, no depth cameras specifically being used here, but the array of color cameras has all this depth information being mapped and that's what all the information from the color cameras is being sort of projected onto. there's a lot of processing Happening Here, so it all comes together to form this really impressive real-time. I mean I use the word immersion very lightly usually, but I will. I want to stress that it's very immersive when you actually get to use it. so hopefully this helps you visualize. so that is pretty cool. but even that doesn't translate perfectly because the feeling of depth actually comes from the distance between your eyes. so a camera lens is one eye, but if you've ever tried to catch something with one eye closed, you know that humans perceive depth by the difference between what you see with your left eye and what you see with your right eye. your brain stitches them together and figures out depth that way. so even that demo doesn't quite get the full realisticness of what I saw on camera, but it's pretty close. the lights will display in Project Starline is literally showing a different image to my left eye and to my right eye. so taking advantage of that biological fact and then letting me actually compute depth on the Fly while doing all the head tracking in real time, it's actually kind of crazy. like if you've ever seen 3D glasses, you know how when you go see a 3D movie- like one of the eyes is blue, one of the eyes is red, that's literally because your left eye will see something map for that and you're right, I will see something that for that and that's how it creates the depth effect. but this is way better than a 3D movie. it's so much smoother and the head tracking and everything that goes with it and it's it's so good. but then the craziest part, the the most impressive part, is the Computing that's happening, which is rendering the people using Starline in real time into these 3D models. so this is not like the metaverse thing or the VR headset tracks face movement and then you can have a eye contact, face-to-face conversation with someone's Cartoon Avatar. but no, no, this is. this is taking the actual Imaging, the lighting, the, the way you actually look, what you're actually wearing, and rendering that out in real time in 3D space and making it look like I'm talking to them through a window. it's kind of amazing. the eye contact is so one-to-one, real looking, and it really just comes from the fact that I'm sitting here looking forward and the person on the other side is also looking forward and so we're actually looking into each other's eyes. so anyway, yeah it, it is. the point is it's super realistic. I promise you, when I was, when I first did my demo, the first time I ever saw it, even knowing that it's 3D- I still felt like I could reach out and like high five him or like fist bump him. he held that Apple out actually, and to my eyes it looked like he could just drop the apple he was holding right on the table in front of me, which of course meant that I looked stupid from this angle because I'm just reaching out at nothing. but we got a bunch of reactions from some other Studio team members who got to join me for this demo. I'll link a video that has some of their reactions below. we should definitely check that out. so it was really only the like slight glitching, a little bit of edges and fading and stuff like that. that kept out of uncanny valley territory. like obviously the eye contact is one thing and the 3d effect even it had spatial audio. so if I leaned over here it would sound like more audio came into one of your ears and that was responsive. but you know, things like in between the fingers or like the edges of certain Fabrics or my hair especially, some of that stuff could kind of break it a little bit and you could tell. but honestly I wasn't thinking about that at all. so you might be thinking kind of the same thing I was after I finished this demo, which is okay, this is super cool. but what is this for? like: what is this sort of a tech demo actually useful for? and the answer is: we don't really know yet. so at this point in time, Google has worked with a few companies- Salesforce, wework and T-Mobile are some examples- who are literally using some of these booths for meetings. basically, I guess theoretically that's better than a zoom call, although it still has its limitations. like the face tracking can only work with one person at a time, which means only one person can be in the booth at a time to get their realistic depth effect, so adding another person doesn't work. I think the question will be closer to being answered when the tech gets even better, like we. it's already gone from the size of a room to the size of like an easel. it could just be the size of a TV with a backpack on it, but this will get more realistic, cheaper, simpler and just better. but you know, here's the thing: I actually don't know that regular people will actually want this like. hear me out, if I know anything about bleeding edge Tech, which I've tried a lot of, it's that regular people, the masses, are not very fast to pay extra for higher Fidelity, like better quality. so the the cutoff for acceptable quality is surprisingly low for the masses. like. think about it. audio quality, I don't know. streaming on Spotify over Bluetooth seems to be good enough for most people. airpods are the most popular headphones in the world. you think about cameras and how smartphone cameras are basically good enough for 99 of the taking pictures of your kids, you know. so convenience is King. that like. that's why, right now, FaceTime and zoom are- it's just a square of a flat low-res video feed on a screen. that's fine. it's fine for most people. when you turn it all the way up to project Starline, which is like this, incredibly realistic, like you can see micro expressions and textures and feel like you're in the room with the person that's over on one side here and FaceTime and zoom are on the other side here, and this is where the masses live. and this is like businesses, you know, getting a booth so they don't have to fly people out for lots of meetings overseas, but it's still too expensive and too difficult to get to for most people. but that's just for now. that's just for this version. now I'm really looking forward to keeping an eye on how this Tech evolves, from Google and even from others who are working on this whole 3D light field display technology stuff. we've actually seen some interesting stuff before. I actually tried an Asus laptop not too many weeks ago that does the same thing. it renders a unique image for each of your eyes and does head tracking for an incredibly realistic 3d effect. but of course, for that you have to look at a certain file that was built in a certain model and work with certain software. this was like rendering real people and just having a conversation. it's crazy. it's crazy. I'm gonna thank you for Google for letting us see this and I'm gonna hopefully be able to try future versions when they get finished, because this is wild. let me know what you guys think. thanks for watching. catch you in the next one. peace [Music]."}, {"title": "This is the Dumbest Product I've Ever Reviewed", "description": "This thing blows\n\nCheck out Dr. Mike at

"foreign\n[Music]\nokay it's kind of hard to believe but\nyeah this is a real product what I'm\nholding is the new Dyson Zone air\npurifying headphones that's exactly what\nthey're called you can look it up so\nwhen this first started popping up on\nactual like Dyson social media channels\nI had to double check the calendar to\nmake sure it wasn't April 1st because\nseriously Dyson are you pranking us\nright now this is It's a thousand\ndollars\nfor air purifying headphones I wasn't\nreally sure what to think probably safe\nto ignore it\nbut then one by one videos started\npopping up on YouTube on Twitter on\nInstagram and people actually started\nasking like hey Marquez can you check\nout those Dyson headphones can you check\nout the Dyson zone so that look you see\nhere is me realizing I just spent a\nthousand dollars plus shipping on\nsomething that I already believe is a\nterrible product but I'm still here to\ndo my job and find out anyway but here's\nthe thing and probably the weirdest part\nand most important part of this whole\nthing\nDyson this product could only have come\nfrom Dyson it it makes no sense but\nmakes all the sense in the world so\nignoring the whole embarrassing social\nmedia campaign around the vacuums for a\nsecond like I love my Dyson vacuum\ncleaner right A lot of people I know\nhave bought Dyson vacuums No Regrets We\nlove these things they're great and then\nover the years Dyson has built up like a\ncult following and loyal fan base over\nwhat is basically\nMotors and filtration like Dyson is a\nMotors and filtration company and\nthey've built that out and turned it\ninto some of the most amazing vacuum\ncleaners in the world and they're also\nsome of the most expensive like\nseriously if you want a stick vacuum you\ncan just get one on Amazon for like a\nhundred bucks easy but then you kind of\nget the feeling that Dyson is the brand\nname that they're all copying but\nnaturally you don't stop there right\nyou're successful with one thing but you\ngot to Branch out so what else do you do\nyou've all seen the Dyson bladeless fan\nthing right I mean this is almost a\nlegendary product on its own the Dyson\nfan slash air purifier in the corner of\nthe room of a 500 a night Airbnb do\nother companies make bladeless fans now\nsure but people want the Dyson one the\n700 Dyson one another successful\nimplementation of Motors infiltration\nthere's also the Dyson hair dryer\nanother cult classic this thing is\nabsolutely incredible I don't even use a\nhair dryer I actually use this thing to\nheat up the dbrand Skins to put on the\nback of my phones and it's awesome for\nthat too another successful\nimplementation of Motors infiltration so\nDyson is no stranger to charging a lot\nof money successfully for a seemingly\nNiche product but that doesn't mean they\ncan't miss you guys have probably heard\nabout maybe you haven't they made a\nfloor lamp too\nmaybe you haven't heard about it because\nit's less successful it's also 850 so\nthey can miss you also might have heard\nabout the car prototype that they\nbrought to CES which like okay yes you\nmake Motors and motors are one part of\nan electric car but there are lots of\nother parts of a car that are really\nhard and trust me a Dyson car is kind of\na tough sell no matter what you're going\nto price it at so Dyson has a lot of\nhits and some complete misses\nso what's this one going to be\nokay so this product is part headphones\npart air purifier\nI know about headphones so let's talk\nabout the headphones part first and\nthese headphones are absolutely wild\nfirst of all\nthey're gigantic like they're absolutely\nhuge I don't even have to tell you that\nnow a lot of the size will make more\nsense when we get to the filtration part\nand everything that's also inside these\near cups later but just as a pair of\nheadphones on your head these things are\nhuge they stick out a lot to this side\nbut honestly it's mostly the weight okay\nso Audio Technica is M50 so I've talked\nabout those in the past very familiar\nheadphones totally normal\n288 grams\nnot that bad on your head then you get\nto like the heaviest headphones we\ntalked about how heavy airpods Max are\nthose are 388 grams which is a lot\nthese are\n588 grams so it feels like I'm wearing a\nfootball helmet these things are so\nheavy now there's a lot of metal but\nthey do try to maximize comfort with\nthese really soft cushions and the ear\ncups are super soft and the top of the\nheadphones are soft and then it's this\npurple velvet color the side pieces are\nmore for stability to keep them in place\non your head and honestly if you're just\nsitting in one place not moving around\ntoo much listening to music in a chair\nor on a train or something I guess then\nthey're not terrible it's just the\nsecond you start moving around or\nlooking up and down or walking that you\nreally feel the weight it seriously\nfeels like a helmet material wise though\nit is nothing but the premium materials\nI gotta say the headphone band is metal\nthe cushions are super soft the ear cups\nare metal through and through you can\nsee the microphones very clearly around\nthe bottom the USBC port and the\ncontrols are actually very very clever\neverything is on the right ear cup and\nit's mostly by this little joystick here\nso instead of trying to swipe on a\nfinicky touch surface or something like\nthat you literally tap up and down on\nthe joystick for volume tap left or\nright for the next track and previous\ntrack and amazingly you can actually\nhold down the joystick to the right or\nleft to scrub forward or backward in\nwhatever audio you're in and it worked\nin a bunch of apps for me too to my\nsurprise worked in apple music worked in\nSpotify my podcast app it didn't work in\nYouTube or SoundCloud but even yeah just\nthe thought of being able to fast\nforward a little bit to the middle of a\npodcast or something on Spotify is kind\nof sick I've never seen that before but\nof course with the super high price tag\nyou hopefully care about how they sound\nso how do these sound big premium\nexpensive active noise cancellation 40\nmillimeter drivers how did these do they\nsound as high-end as they cost\nno they don't but they sound okay I mean\nthey sound like some two to three\nhundred dollar headphones that I've\nheard even though they're built like 400\nheadphones but I'll say the sound\noverall is pretty balanced and\nreasonably Bassy and Punchy in the low\nend there's a pretty good passive seal\nwith these ear cups and then the active\nnoise cancellation does a little extra\nwork for you it is just a Bluetooth\nheadphone there's no wired connection\nand nothing fancy as far as lossless\naudio or special codecs or anything like\nthat but you know they sound crisp with\na little extra brightness in the highs\nwhat's more impressive is so the active\nnoise cancellation is pretty good but\nthe transparency mode is actually\nexcellent this is the best I've heard\nfrom anything that isn't airpods and you\ncan double tap the right ear cup to\nswitch between transparency mode and\nnoise cancellation the battery life of\nthese is about 50 hours which is right\nat the top of its class where noise\ncancellation headphones with ANC on\num they also don't have an on off switch\nso they do on head detection kind of\nlike airpods Max so when you take them\noff your head they go into this I title\nmode and you put them back on they play\nthis nice chime they turn back on and\nnow you're listening to music again\nergonomically they're not anything\nspecial but we know the joystick for the\ncontrols the transparency mode\nthese are pretty good headphones\nso that brings us to part two so like I\nsaid this is a two in one product part\nheadphones part air purifier let's just\ncompletely ignore the why for a second\njust so we can just understand what's\nhappening and how this works so these\nheadphones come with this little plastic\nvisor thing so inside the ear cups of\nthe headphones you can pop off the\noutside cover and that's where these\nfilters go that came in the box and\nthose filters are covering these air\nintakes and Tiny micro compressors that\nsuck in the air from the outside world\nthese filters help purify the air by\ncutting down 99 of pollutants as small\nas 0.1 microns then they pass that clean\nair through these slots the visor\nconnects the headphones via magnets to\nthese slots and creates a seal so that\nthe air is channeled down through it and\npasses over your nose and mouth through\nthe mesh at the front it is a pretty\nintricate setup but the idea is pretty\nstraightforward basically like oh okay\nyou've got noise pollution noise\ncanceling headphones gotcha cover oh\nyou've got air pollution too\nfresh air all the time we got you\ncovered now the timing of these was\nactually super unfortunate because\ncontrary to what you might be thinking\nright now this has nothing to do with\nthe pandemic nothing to do with covet it\nhappened to be announced right around\nthe same time\num but this is really directly\nadvertised that people who live in or\ncommute in cities with bad air quality\ndust pollen smog gas fumes grass\nclippings whatever it is just bad air\nquality so the idea is you're about to\ngo out on your commute with the polluted\nworld around you so you put the\nheadphones on you snap the visor on and\nnow you're uh you're getting the fresh\nair the entire time you're outside with\nthese fans spinning\nit's the idea anyway now I went through\nthe painful exercise of going out and\ntesting these things so you don't have\nto okay so I'm looking kind of\nridiculous on public streets because hey\nI want to see if this will actually work\nI walked past roadways to see if I could\nsmell gasoline I walked past Landscaping\nto see if I could smell pollen and lawn\nclippings I walked into a public Porta\nJohn to see if I could survive you know\nand uh bad news I could still smell a\nlot of everything I mean there was a\nnice little stream of fresh air going\nover my nose and mouth it's a nice\nlittle breeze but yeah you can still\nsmell everything I think right off the\nbat there's really actually two main\nproblems that hit me immediately with\nthis setup one is when you put all these\ntogether and you put them on uh the fans\nwhich are in the ear cups start spinning\nup and the air compressors turn on and\nyou can hear that because it's right on\nyour ear and so you're hearing that\nthrough your music so you can kind of\ndrown It Out by turning the audio up but\nthat right off the bat was kind of\nannoying but then the second is there's\nno seal like you can still have air\npassing over your nose and mouth but\nthings can also slip in above and below\neven if it's close to your mouth so they\nwant you to have as little of a gap as\npossible and it's adjustable so you can\nshrink that visor down as much as you\nwant to basically have it touching the\ntip of your nose but stuff will still\nget in as long as there's no seal and\nnobody wants to walk around breathing\nfrom a literal tube like a scuba diving\nmouthpiece so yeah this is just a\nbuilt-in flaw of the fact that nobody\nwants that that's the way it's designed\nplus there's a bunch of other quirks\nlike once the filtration gets going the\nbattery life goes from 50 hours to two\nhours the visor is super light and\nflimsy because it's completely plastic\npresumably to be lightweight and keep it\nbalanced on your head but then it also\nhas all kinds of weird scratches and\npoor finishes on the mesh and rubber and\nplastic and just feels really cheap and\nnone of that none of that even touches\njust how ridiculous you look and then\nthere's the pull medical problem so I'm\nnot a doctor but I do have a friend who\nis Mike also happens to have a YouTube\nchannel you might have heard of him but\nhe explain to me exactly why this\nproduct is even more flawed than I\nrealized on the surface yeah so I see a\nproduct that actually confuses me more\nthan anything because I don't know who\nthe intended customer is because they\nvery clearly say this is not a medical\ngrade product there's no seal that\nexists here on like a traditional n95\nmask I look at the marketing material\nand I see somebody out in a city in a\nsubway station and on the streets and\nthere's there's pollen there's smog\nthere's all kinds of other things and\nthey put this on and suddenly the air\nthey're breathing is clean they don't\nsmell or inhale any of it is that a\ndream or am I missing something they say\nthat the product cleans up to 0.1\nmicrons particles out of the air but\nit's not HEPA rated because a HEPA rated\nfilter will actually filter particles\nwith a\n99.95 efficacy it's not as good as an\nn95 mask which has a seal and this is\nwhere a lot of misinformation actually\nspreads with n95 masks because when we\nsay n95 what we're saying is they have a\n95 percent efficacy at filtering\nparticles that are 0.3 microns and you\nmight say well a covid particle is 0.1\nMicron so does that mean they get\nthrough n95 masks that's what some\npeople who are anti-master said right\nmost coveted particles that travel in\nthere are attached to things water\ndroplets respiratory droplets that kind\nof thing so they're already bigger than\n0.3 and they end up being captured by\nthe mask but they specifically choose\n0.3 microns because when you go smaller\nthan that like a coveted particle at\npoint one it follows something known as\nBrownian motion and this is where these\nsmall particles move so randomly around\nwhen they're dissolved in a gas like our\nair that they end up being trapped by\nThe n95 Mask even better than the 0.3\nokay there's a lot of things to why this\ndoesn't make sense I also saw a tweet\nabout how if you are specifically\nthinking about covid and you are someone\nwho has covid and you wear this now when\nyou exhale all that air blowing is now\njust being ejected out into space where\nit'd normally stay in The Mask yes like\nthis device is not designed to keep your\nair and your particles to your face like\na mask would yeah uh so what the company\nhas said in response to this that\nthere's enough room to wear a mask in\nbetween but to me if you have room for\nan n95 masks this eliminates the need\nfor this product because the n95 mask is\nmore effective at filtering the air and\ncreating a seal in this product so why\nin the world would you wear a mask that\nfilters better than this and then this\nthing on top of it but what I worry\nabout is it actually creates risk and it\ncreates risks in two ways one is that it\nblows air directly onto your nose and\nmouth which are your mucous membranes\nanytime you have air circulating areas\nthat have a natural level of moisture\nyou dry them out dry mucous membranes\nare a problem because they crack and\ncreate openings for pathogen Center your\nbody then it's cold outside this thing\nis blowing cold air at your mucous\nmembranes which actually causes\nvasoconstriction meaning less blood flow\nless white blood cells in the area\nprotecting you another problem and then\nthe real problem is I'm going to really\nHammer at home yes yes they say this is\nlike Urban environments where pollution\nis high there's brake dust car pollution\nall very valid all big problems we\nshould address\nbut in urban environments based on CDC\ndata\nthe rate per hundred thousand of debts\nfrom chronic respiratory disease is\naround 35. but you know what's 33\npercent higher than that\nunintentional accidents that goes up all\nthe way to 47 per hundred thousand yeah\nand you know what's increasing rates of\nunintentional accidents are you saying\nthat these noise canceling headphones\nmight actually cause more problems than\nthey solve yeah so why did they do this\nDyson is a weird company like I said at\nthe beginning they're they're a motor\nand filtration company but they've had\nso many hits they've made these Niche\nproducts like stick vacuums and air\npurifiers and hair dryers into like cult\nfavorites which is crazy I can actually\nsee how this product came to exist and\nhow it ended up being a thousand dollars\nactually honestly\nthe thousand dollars part is the easy\npart like when you just look at the\nmaterials and the Cool Tech and the\npackaging that went into this thing it's\nkind of silly these headphones\nthemselves are super heavy but yeah\nthey're all metal the cups are metal the\nbands are metal and there's obviously a\nton of tech in here the packaging is\nhilarious there's not just the\nheadphones and the visor which look like\na smiley face but there's also a super\nhigh quality carrying case with felt\nlining there's a thick braided elastic\nstrap for that carrying case there's an\nextra set of filters there is the\nsoftest velvet headphone carrying pouch\nI've ever seen there is a dual color\nbraided USBC cable with a headphone jack\nadapter there's a metal airplane adapter\nthere's what I assume is a reusable\nfilter cleaner with a handle and another\ncarrying pouch for just the cables and\nthe accessories also super soft

lot of companies use\ncalled the loss leader strategy Barbara\nCorcoran was on my podcast from Shark\nTank and she taught me about this\nconcept called Lost leader and basically\nshe believes that products that are\ngimmicky in this vein will actually not\nmake company money but they'll draw\nenough press that they'll sell other\nproducts perhaps that's what's going on\nthey earn press yes yeah because there's\nlost leaders that are like oh we can\nafford to sell you this hardware for\ncheap and lose money on it because you\nwill buy the software and make the money\nback this one is a loss leader because\nno one should buy it and probably no one\nwill but it'll generate enough Buzz that\npeople talk about Dyson we're doing it\nright now and they'll be on them yeah\nyou win this round dice\nhere we are talking about your stupid\nheadphones with your stupid filter and\nit's not you didn't even have to pay for\nan ad like you wanted to so\nyeah well played\nthanks for watching\ncatch you guys in the next one\npeace\n", "punctuated_text": "foreign [Music]. okay, it's kind of hard to believe, but yeah, this is a real product. what I'm holding is the new Dyson Zone air purifying headphones. that's exactly what they're called. you can look it up. so when this first started popping up on actual, like Dyson social media channels, I had to double check the calendar to make sure it wasn't April 1st, because, seriously, Dyson, are you pranking us right now? this is, It's a thousand dollars for air purifying headphones. I wasn't really sure what to think. probably safe to ignore it. but then, one by one, videos started popping up on YouTube, on Twitter, on Instagram, and people actually started asking like, hey, Marquez, can you check out those Dyson headphones, can you check out the Dyson zone? so that, look, you see, here is me realizing I just spent a thousand dollars plus shipping on something that I already believe is a terrible product. but I'm still here to do my job and find out anyway. but here's the thing, and probably the weirdest part and most important part of this whole thing: Dyson. this product could only have come from Dyson it. it makes no sense, but makes all the sense in the world. so, ignoring the whole embarrassing social media campaign around the vacuums for a second, like, I love my Dyson vacuum cleaner. right, A lot of people I know have bought Dyson vacuums. No Regrets, We love these things, they're great. and then over the years Dyson has built up like a cult following and loyal fan base over what is basically Motors and filtration. like, Dyson is a Motors and filtration company and they've built that out and turned it into some of the most amazing vacuum cleaners in the world. and they're also some of the most expensive. like, seriously, if you want a stick vacuum, you can just get one on Amazon for like a hundred bucks, easy. but then you kind of get the feeling that Dyson is the brand name that they're all copying. but naturally you don't stop there. right, you're successful with one thing, but you got to Branch out, so what else do you do. you've all seen the Dyson bladeless fan thing. right, I mean, this is almost a legendary product on its own. the Dyson fan slash air purifier in the corner of the room of a 500 a night Airbnb. do other companies make bladeless fans? now, sure, but people want the Dyson one, the 700 Dyson one- another successful implementation of Motors infiltration. there's also the Dyson hair dryer- another cult classic. this thing is absolutely incredible. I don't even use a hair dryer. I actually use this thing to heat up the dbrand Skins to put on the back of my phones, and it's awesome for that too. another successful implementation of Motors infiltration. so Dyson is no stranger to charging a lot of money successfully for a seemingly Niche product. but that doesn't mean they can't miss. you guys have probably heard about- maybe you haven't- they made a floor lamp too. maybe you haven't heard about it because it's less successful. it's also 850, so they can miss. you also might have heard about the car prototype that they brought to CES, which like: okay, yes, you make Motors, and motors are one part of an electric car, but there are lots of other parts of a car that are really hard and, trust me, a Dyson car is kind of a tough sell, no matter what you're going to price it at. so Dyson has a lot of hits and some complete misses. so what's this one going to be? okay? so this product is part headphones, part air purifier. I know about headphones, so let's talk about the headphones part first, and these headphones are absolutely wild. first of all, they're gigantic, like they're absolutely huge. I don't even have to tell you that now a lot of the size will make more sense when we get to the filtration part and everything that's also inside these ear cups later. but just as a pair of headphones on your head, these things are huge. they stick out a lot to this side but honestly, it's mostly the weight okay. so Audio Technica is M50, so I've talked about those in the past- very familiar headphones, totally normal- 288 grams, not that bad on your head. then you get to like the heaviest headphones. we talked about how heavy airpods Max are. those are 388 grams, which is a lot. these are 588 grams so it feels like I'm wearing a football helmet. these things are so heavy. now there's a lot of metal but they do try to maximize comfort with these really soft cushions and the ear cups are super soft and the top of the headphones are soft and then it's this purple velvet color. the side pieces are more for stability, to keep them in place on your head and honestly, if you're just sitting in one place, not moving around too much, listening to music in a chair or on a train or something I guess, then they're not terrible. it's just the second you start moving around or looking up and down or walking that you really feel the weight. it seriously feels like a helmet material wise, though it is nothing but the premium materials, I gotta say. the headphone band is metal, the cushions are super soft. the ear cups are metal through and through. you can see the microphones very clearly around the bottom. the USBC port and the controls are actually very, very clever. everything is on the right ear cup and it's mostly by this little joystick here. so instead of trying to swipe on a finicky touch surface or something like that, you literally tap up and down on the joystick for volume, tap left or right for the next track and previous track, and, amazingly, you can actually hold down the joystick to the right or left to scrub forward or backward in whatever audio you're in. and it worked in a bunch of apps for me too, to my surprise worked in apple music, worked in Spotify, my podcast app. it didn't work in YouTube or SoundCloud, but even- yeah, just the thought of being able to fast forward a little bit to the middle of a podcast or something on Spotify is kind of sick. I've never seen that before. but of course, with the super high price tag, you hopefully care about how they sound. so how do these sound? big, premium, expensive, active noise cancellation, 40 millimeter drivers. how did these do they sound as high-end as they cost? no, they don't, but they sound okay. I mean they sound like some two to three hundred dollar headphones that I've heard, even though they're built like 400 headphones. but I'll say the sound overall is pretty balanced and reasonably Bassy and Punchy in the low end. there's a pretty good passive seal with these ear cups and then the active noise cancellation does a little extra work for you. it is just a Bluetooth headphone. there's no wired connection and nothing fancy as far as lossless audio or special codecs or anything like that. but you know they sound crisp, with a little extra brightness in the highs. what's more impressive is so the active noise cancellation is pretty good, but the transparency mode is actually excellent. this is the best I've heard from anything that isn't airpods, and you can double tap the right ear cup to switch between transparency mode and noise cancellation. the battery life of these is about 50 hours, which is right at the top of its class where noise cancellation headphones with ANC on um. they also don't have an on off switch, so they do on head detection kind of like airpods Max. so when you take them off your head. they go into this I title mode and you put them back on. they play this nice chime, they turn back on and now you're listening to music again. ergonomically they're not anything special, but we know the joystick for the controls, the transparency mode. these are pretty good headphones. so that brings us to part two. so, like I said, this is a two in one product: part headphones, part air purifier. let's just completely ignore the why for a second, just so we can just understand what's happening and how this works. so these headphones come with this little plastic visor thing. so inside the ear cups of the headphones you can pop off the outside cover and that's where these filters go. that came in the box and those filters are covering these air intakes and Tiny micro compressors that suck in the air from the outside world. these filters help purify the air by cutting down 99 of pollutants as small as 0.1 microns. then they pass that clean air through these slots. the visor connects the headphones via magnets to these slots and creates a seal so that the air is channeled down through it and passes over your nose and mouth through the mesh at the front. it is a pretty intricate setup, but the idea is pretty straightforward, basically like: oh okay, you've got noise pollution, noise canceling headphones, gotcha cover. oh, you've got air pollution too fresh air all the time. we got you covered. now. the timing of these was actually super unfortunate because, contrary to what you might be thinking right now, this has nothing to do with the pandemic, nothing to do with covet. it happened to be announced right around the same time. um, but this is really directly advertised that people who live in or commute in cities with bad air quality- dust, pollen, smog, gas fumes, grass clippings, whatever- it is just bad air quality. so the idea is you're about to go out on your commute with the polluted world around you, so you put the headphones on, you snap the visor on and now you're- uh, you're getting the fresh air the entire time. you're outside with these fans spinning. it's the idea anyway. now I went through the painful exercise of going out and testing these things, so you don't have to, okay. so I'm looking kind of ridiculous on public streets because, hey, I want to see if this will actually work. I walked past roadways to see if I could smell gasoline. I walked past Landscaping to see if I could smell pollen and lawn clippings. I walked into a public, Porta John, to see if I could survive, you know. and uh, bad news, I could still smell a lot of everything. I mean, there was a nice little stream of fresh air going over my nose and mouth. it's a nice little breeze. but yeah, you can still smell everything, I think, right off the bat. there's really actually two main problems that hit me immediately with this setup. one is when you put all these together and you put them on, uh, the fans which are in the ear cups start spinning up and the air compressors turn on and you can hear that because it's right on your ear and so you're hearing that through your music. so you can kind of drown It Out by turning the audio up. but that right off the bat, was kind of annoying. but then the second is there's no seal, like you can still have air passing over your nose and mouth, but things can also slip in above and below, even if it's close to your mouth. so they want you to have as little of a gap as possible and it's adjustable, so you can shrink that visor down as much as you want to basically have it touching the tip of your nose, but stuff will still get in as long as there's no seal and nobody wants to walk around breathing from a literal tube like a scuba diving mouthpiece. so yeah, this is just a built-in flaw of the fact that nobody wants that. that's the way it's designed. plus, there's a bunch of other quirks, like, once the filtration gets going, the battery life goes from 50 hours to two hours. the visor is super light and flimsy because it's completely plastic, presumably to be lightweight and keep it balanced on your head. but then it also has all kinds of weird scratches and poor finishes on the mesh and rubber and plastic and just feels really cheap. and none of that. none of that even touches just how ridiculous you look. and then there's the pull medical problem. so I'm not a doctor, but I do have a friend who is Mike also happens to have a YouTube channel. you might have heard of him, but he explain to me exactly why this product is even more flawed than I realized on the surface. yeah, so I see a product that actually confuses me more than anything, because I don't know who the intended customer is, because they very clearly say this is not a medical grade product. there's no seal that exists here on like a traditional n95 mask. I look at the marketing material and I see somebody out in a city, in a subway station and on the streets, and there's, there's pollen, there's smog, there's all kinds of other things, and they put this on and suddenly the air they're breathing is clean. they don't smell or inhale any of it. is that a dream or am I missing something? they say that the product cleans up to 0.1 microns particles out of the air, but it's not HEPA rated, because a HEPA rated filter will actually filter particles with a 99.95 efficacy. it's not as good as an n95 mask which has a seal. and this is where a lot of misinformation actually spreads with n95 masks, because when we say n95, what we're saying is they have a 95 percent efficacy at filtering particles that are 0.3 microns. and you might say: well, a covid particle is 0.1 Micron, so does that mean they get through n95 masks? that's what some people who are anti-master said. right, most coveted particles that travel in there are attached to things- water droplets, respiratory droplets, that kind of thing- so they're already bigger than 0.3 and they end up being captured by the mask. but they specifically choose 0.3 microns because when you go smaller than that, like a coveted particle, at point one. it follows something known as Brownian motion, and this is where these small particles move so randomly around when they're dissolved in a gas like our air, that they end up being trapped by The n95 Mask even better than the 0.3. okay, there's a lot of things to why this doesn't make sense. I also saw a tweet about how, if you are specifically thinking about covid and you are someone who has covid and you wear this now when you exhale, all that air blowing is now just being ejected out into space where it'd normally stay in The Mask. yes, like this device is not designed to keep your air and your particles to your face like a mask would. yeah, uh, so what? the company has said in response to this that there's enough room to wear a mask in between. but to me, if you have room for an n95 masks, this eliminates the need for this product, because the n95 mask is more effective at filtering the air and creating a seal in this product. so why in the world would you wear a mask that filters better than this? and then this thing on top of it? but what I worry about is it actually creates risk, and it creates risks in two ways. one is that it blows air directly onto your nose and mouth, which are your mucous membranes. anytime you have air circulating- areas that have a natural level of moisture- you dry them out. dry mucous membranes are a problem because they crack and create openings for pathogen Center your body. then it's cold outside. this thing is blowing cold air at your mucous membranes, which actually causes vasoconstriction, meaning less blood flow, less white blood cells in the area protecting you. another problem. and then the real problem is: I'm going to really Hammer at home. yes, yes, they say this is like Urban environments where pollution is high. there's brake, dust, car pollution, all very valid, all big problems we should address. but in urban environments, based on CDC data, the rate per hundred thousand of debts from chronic respiratory disease is around 35.. but you know what's? 33 percent higher than that: unintentional accidents. that goes up all the way to 47 per hundred thousand. yeah, and you know what's? increasing rates of unintentional accidents. are you saying that these noise canceling headphones might actually cause more problems than they solve? yeah, so why did they do this? Dyson is a weird company, like I said at the beginning. they're they're a motor and filtration company, but they've had so many hits they've made these Niche products like stick vacuums and air purifiers and hair dryers into like cult favorites, which is crazy. I can actually see how this product came to exist and how it ended up being a thousand dollars. actually. honestly, the thousand dollars part is the easy part. like when you just look at the materials and the Cool Tech and the packaging that went into this thing, it's kind of silly. these headphones themselves are super heavy, but yeah, they're all metal. the cups are metal, the bands are metal and there's obviously a ton of tech in here. the packaging is hilarious. there's not just the headphones and the visor, which look like a smiley face, but there's also a super high quality carrying case with felt lining. there's a thick braided elastic strap for that carrying case. there's an extra set of filters. there is the softest velvet headphone carrying pouch I've ever seen. there is a dual color braided USBC cable with a headphone jack adapter. there's a metal airplane adapter. there's what I assume is a reusable filter cleaner with a handle, and another carrying pouch for just the cables and the accessories- also super soft. and then there's this Dyson app that connects the headphones. that lets you not only change the settings but also gives you a live look at a summary of the air quality in your area and then gives me a live readout of the audio levels of my my environment and how much sound the noise cancellation mode is preventing from getting to my ears. I've never seen anything like this with headphones and like live real-time data. visualization like this gives you a summary of your fan speed usage, your noise cancellation usage over time and gives you an estimate of your filter life and a direct link to buy new filters for once you run out of the ones that come in the box. if you showed me all this repair headphones and never even told me about the filter thing or what brand it was from, I would assume that these are at least 400 headphones. but at the end of the day, most of this, like so many other things in the tech world, can be explained by branding. like it's only Dyson that could have pulled this off and gotten this thing as far as it has to get into this video. but there's a sort of a term that you've probably heard in the business world before that a lot of companies use, called the loss leader strategy. Barbara Corcoran was on my podcast from Shark Tank and she taught me about this concept called Lost leader and basically she believes that products that are gimmicky in this vein will actually not make company money, but they'll draw enough press that they'll sell other products. perhaps that's what's going on. they earn press, yes, yeah, because there's lost leaders that are like: oh, we can afford to sell you this hardware for cheap and lose money on it because you will buy the software and make the money back. this one is a loss leader because no one should buy it and probably no one will, but it'll generate enough Buzz that people talk about Dyson. we're doing it right now and they'll be on them. yeah, you win this round. dice. here we are talking about your stupid headphones with your stupid filter, and it's not. you didn't even have to pay for an ad like you wanted to. so, yeah, well played. thanks for watching. catch you guys in the next one. peace."}, {"title": "Google Pixel Tablet Impressions: A New Bargain?", "description": "We haven't had a hit Google tablet since Nexus 7.

"text": "hey what's up MKBHD here okay so this\nnew pixel tablet is really interesting I\ngot to spend about an hour with it\nbefore this announcement and I've Come\nAway both knowing that I don't need one\nbut really liking it anyway so welcome\nto this first Hands-On and first\nimpressions video also feel free to\ncheck out the pixel fold Impressions\nwhich also has gone live today it's an\neighteen hundred dollar folding phone\nfrom Google pretty crazy I'll link it\nbelow but also make sure to get\nsubscribed and stay tuned because we\nhave a video of something a little more\nexclusive coming up also from Google\nthat you probably haven't seen yet but\nthis tablet this tablet is 499 so really\ncompetitively priced and it basically\nhas one killer feature you kind of\nprobably already know where I'm going\nwith this so design wise it's pretty\nsimple right pretty basic with this\naluminum enclosure but fully coated in\nthis soft touch finish that's really\nnice it almost doesn't even feel like\nmetal anymore which is funny it's also\npretty lightweight there's a single\neight megapixel camera on the back and a\npower button that doubles as the\nfingerprint reader at the corner overall\nlooks like a pretty normal tablet right\nso what's the killer feature is it a\nsoftware trick is it the screen is it a\nstylus\nwell you see those four pins down at the\nbottom of the tablet right below that\nGoogle logo on the back those are power\nand data pins that line up with these\nfour pins on this dock that's included\nin the Box sick so with the power of\nmagnets this tablet slaps onto the back\nand basically becomes a Google Nest Hub\nMax more or less so this is the thing\nthey gave us a teaser of at the last i o\nand honestly it's as awesome as it looks\nit works great there's enough magnets\nthat there's like a pretty firm pressure\nneeded to take the tablet off of the\ndock but when you put it back on it\ngrabs it and holds it firmly in place\nand through those pins it instantly\nstarts charging at 15 watts and connects\nto the larger speaker inside the dock so\nthat's upgraded audio over the tablet's\nbuilt-in speakers so a couple things on\nthis first of all I'm kind of surprised\nthat we hadn't seen this earlier we have\nseen a couple more basic versions of\nthis there was a Lenovo tablet a while\nago that would like dock into a speaker\nbut I'm glad to see Google actually\nfleshing out this idea and doubling up\non its use they told me something like\n80 plus percent of tablet use happens in\nthe home so for those other 20 when it's\njust sitting around your home it makes\nsense to just like pop it onto a dock\nand now it's this nice polished Nest Hub\ndisplay but then also I'm pretty pumped\nabout the the dock actually being\nincluded in the box but do note it is\nthe only charger included in the box so\nthere is a usb-c port on the side of the\ntablet but there isn't any like USBC\ncable or wall brick to plug straight\ninto the wall so the only charger is the\ndock which is fine but if you have\nanother USBC cable it will charge via a\nwire but then the dock itself it does\nnot charge via USBC it charges with a\nwall wart to this like Barrel charger so\njust so you know also theoretically I\nguess you could go out and buy a couple\nmore of these docks and put them in\nother places around your home if you\njust wanted to I'm not actually sure\nwhat the price of just the dock would be\nyet if they're going to sell that\nindividually I'll ask I'll put a little\nupdate up here if Google's able to\nanswer by the time I post this video but\nit seems like yeah one in the living\nroom one in the bedroom could be a thing\nbut then when you pop the tablet onto\nthe dock and lock it it activates what's\ncalled Hub mode and basically it just\nbecomes a Google Nest Hub and so it can\ndo any of the things that a nest Hub\nwould do it can be a digital photo frame\nif you want it to be it can be of course\na smart home control panel which is what\nmost people want home hub to do there's\nalso some smart settings in here about\nnot letting you into all of your other\napps when it is your family's screen\nthat's why you lock it to enable this\nmode but then when you're using it as\nyour personal tablet you unlock it and\nhave access to everything oh also they\nmade this a pretty unique case that has\na wire stand that holds it up like\nsurprisingly firmly but since it's just\na big circular wire it has enough room\nto slap it onto the dock and not be\ninterrupted there's no extra magnets\nneeded so I don't have to take the case\noff to dock it pretty smart either way\nI'm just thinking like this is basically\ndouble pulling up the functionality of\nthe tablet the nest Hub Max that's on\nsale right now is like 230 dollars so\nhey if you're gonna spend 500 bucks on a\ntablet and you also get that device out\nof it it's kind of cool\nthe rest of the tablet honestly\npretty mid it's just very average like\nthere's not too much crazy other stuff\ngoing on with the specs I think the the\nspec for the display probably tells the\nwhole story about the rest of the tablet\nthis is a an 11 inch 60 hertz LCD\ndisplay yeah it's 2560 by 1600 which is\npretty solid and very reasonable\nbrightness for using it around the house\nand indoors nothing too crazy 500 nits\nit's going to be perfectly fine for\nwatching videos or movies on the couch\nor even handing it to a kid which is\nwhat a lot of people do with tablets\nnowadays but it's not trying to compete\nat the high end like a workstation High\nrefresh rate iPad type of thing fun fact\ntoo though you can also get one with a\nblack bezel they've showed all these\nteasers of the ones with white bezels\nand I was always commenting on that on\nthe podcast but turns out the porcelain\ncolor and rose color have white bezels\nbut the Hazel colored one has black\nbezels so you at least have that choice\nthere is also a tensor G2 chip inside so\nthe same chip we've had for half a year\nin the pixel 7 line there's eight gigs\nof RAM and either 128 or 256 gigs of\nstorage and a 27 watt hour battery which\nI believe will translate to right around\n7 000 milliamp hours the 8 megapixel\ncamera on the back it's super basic it\ndoesn't even have a portrait mode that's\nnot really the focus of this device the\ncameras are more just for being able to\ndo simple photos and video calls like\nyou'd find on a nest Hub I do wonder if\nyou could use this tablet wall docked as\na security camera I'm not sure I didn't\nget to try that or find that during my\ndemo time but I'll definitely be digging\naround for that sort of stuff in the\nfull review but I also said this in the\nin the pixel fold Impressions video\nwhich is it's an Android tablet still\nand it's been a minute since we've had a\nreal hit of an Android tablet probably\nfor Google it's been since the Nexus 7.\nand so this one has a pretty clear value\nproposition of the killer feature of it\nbeing two devices in one but then you\nstill have the software question which\nis like what are you actually going to\ndo on this tablet now I think with a\nwith a middle tier media tablet like\nthis people probably won't be asking\nthat question as much but still for me I\njust wonder like what about multitasking\nwhat about split screen apps and all the\nother things you expect out of a big\nscreen so I think Google's being smart\nabout intentionally not starting with\nsome crazy 800 premium tablet because\nthat's what people will be asking and\nimmediately starting to try to do with a\npowerful high-end tablet but with this\none you just cover the basics like side\nby side split screen multitasking is\nhere and even optimizing Google's 50\nplus apps for tablets they've talked a\nbig game about this so they have\nmulti-column layouts and they don't just\nlook like stretched out smartphone apps\nwhich is good they're really responsive\nto the size of the screen so so this\ntablet will benefit from all the\nimprovements that also went into the\neighteen hundred dollar pixel fold which\nis pretty cool but yeah I think for a\n499 tablet it settles nicely into the\nmid-range well actually here we go quick\nlittle update I just got an email back\nsaying Google will be selling the dock\nseparately from the tablet if you want\nanother one for 130 dollars\nthink about it like that it's pretty\ngood value 500 bucks for the tablet and\nthe dock means you get about 370 for the\ntablet and 130 for the dock that's\npretty cheap it's pretty good I'm\ncurious what you guys are thinking let\nme know in the comments if you think\nyou'd be interested in getting one of\nthese but more importantly what do

I'll link it below. but also make sure to get subscribed and stay tuned, because we have a video of something a little more exclusive coming up, also from Google, that you probably haven't seen yet. but this tablet, this tablet is 499, so really competitively priced, and it basically has one killer feature. you kind of probably already know where I'm going with this. so design wise, it's pretty simple, right, pretty basic with this aluminum enclosure, but fully coated in this soft touch finish. that's really nice. it almost doesn't even feel like metal anymore, which is funny. it's also pretty lightweight. there's a single eight megapixel camera on the back and a power button that doubles as the fingerprint reader at the corner. overall looks like a pretty normal tablet, right. so what's the killer feature? is it a software trick? is it the screen. is it a stylus? well, you see those four pins down at the bottom of the tablet, right below that Google logo on the back. those are power and data pins that line up with these four pins on this dock that's included in the Box- sick. so with the power of magnets, this tablet slaps onto the back and basically becomes a Google Nest Hub Max, more or less. so. this is the thing they gave us a teaser of at the last i? o and honestly, it's as awesome as it looks, it works great. there's enough magnets that there's like a pretty firm pressure needed to take the tablet off of the dock. but when you put it back on, it grabs it and holds it firmly in place and through those pins it instantly starts charging at 15 watts and connects to the larger speaker inside the dock. so that's upgraded audio over the tablet's built-in speakers. so a couple things on this. first of all, I'm kind of surprised that we hadn't seen this earlier. we have seen a couple more basic versions of this. there was a Lenovo tablet a while ago that would like dock into a speaker, but I'm glad to see Google actually fleshing out this idea and doubling up on its use. they told me, something like 80 plus percent of tablet use happens in the home. so for those other 20, when it's just sitting around your home, it makes sense to just like pop it onto a dock. and now it's this nice polished Nest Hub display. but then also I'm pretty pumped about the the dock actually being included in the box. but do note, it is the only charger included in the box. so there is a usb-c port on the side of the tablet but there isn't any like USBC cable or wall brick to plug straight into the wall. so the only charger is the dock, which is fine. but if you have another USBC cable it will charge via a wire, but then the dock itself. it does not charge via USBC, it charges with a wall wart to this like Barrel charger. so just so you know. also, theoretically, I guess you could go out and buy a couple more of these docks and put them in other places around your home if you just wanted to. I'm not actually sure what the price of just the dock would be. yet if they're going to sell that individually, I'll ask. I'll put a little update up here if Google's able to answer by the time I post this video. but it seems like, yeah, one in the living room, one in the bedroom could be a thing, but then when you pop the tablet onto the dock and lock it, it activates what's called Hub mode and basically it just becomes a Google Nest Hub and so it can do any of the things that a nest Hub would do. it can be a digital photo frame, if you want it to be. it can be, of course, a smart home control panel, which is what most people want home hub to do. there's also some smart settings in here about not letting you into all of your other apps when it is your family's screen. that's why you lock it to enable this mode, but then, when you're using it as your personal tablet, you unlock it and have access to everything. oh, also, they made this a pretty unique case that has a wire stand that holds it up like surprisingly firmly, but since it's just a big circular wire, it has enough room to slap it onto the dock and not be interrupted. there's no extra magnets needed, so I don't have to take the case off to dock it. pretty smart either way. I'm just thinking like this is basically double pulling up the functionality of the tablet. the nest Hub Max that's on sale right now is like 230 dollars. so hey, if you're gonna spend 500 bucks on a tablet and you also get that device out of it, it's kind of cool. the rest of the tablet honestly pretty mid. it's just very average. like there's not too much crazy other stuff going on with the specs. I think the the spec for the display probably tells the whole story about the rest of the tablet. this is a an 11 inch 60 hertz LCD display. yeah, it's 2560 by 1600, which is pretty solid and very reasonable brightness for using it around the house and indoors: nothing too crazy: 500 nits. it's going to be perfectly fine for watching videos or movies on the couch or even handing it to a kid, which is what a lot of people do with tablets nowadays. but it's not trying to compete at the high end like a workstation High refresh rate iPad type of thing. fun fact too, though: you can also get one with a black bezel. they've showed all these teasers of the ones with white bezels and I was always commenting on that on the podcast, but turns out the porcelain color and rose color have white bezels, but the Hazel colored one has black bezels. so you at least have that choice. there is also a tensor G2 chip inside, so the same chip we've had for half a year. in the pixel 7 line there's eight gigs of RAM and either 128 or 256 gigs of storage and a 27 watt hour battery, which I believe will translate to right around 7 000 milliamp hours. the 8 megapixel camera on the back: it's super basic. it doesn't even have a portrait mode. that's not really the focus of this device. the cameras are more just for being able to do simple photos and video calls, like you'd find on a nest Hub. I do wonder if you could use this tablet wall docked as a security camera. I'm not sure. I didn't get to try that or find that during my demo time, but I'll definitely be digging around for that sort of stuff in the full review. but I also said this in the in the pixel fold Impressions video, which is: it's an Android tablet still, and it's been a minute since we've had a real hit of an Android tablet. probably for Google, it's been since the Nexus 7.. and so this one has a pretty clear value proposition of the killer feature of it being two devices in one. but then you still have the software question which is like what are you actually going to do on this tablet? now I think with a with a middle tier media tablet like this, people probably won't be asking that question as much, but still, for me, I just wonder, like, what about multitasking, what about split screen apps and all the other things you expect out of a big screen? so I think Google's being smart about intentionally not starting with some crazy 800 premium tablet- because that's what people will be asking- and immediately starting to try to do with a powerful, high-end tablet, but with this one you just cover the basics, like side by side split screen multitasking is here- and even optimizing Google's 50 plus apps for tablets. they've talked a big game about this, so they have multi-column layouts and they don't just look like stretched out smartphone apps, which is good. they're really responsive to the size of the screen. so so this tablet will benefit from all the improvements. that also went into the eighteen hundred dollar pixel fold, which is pretty cool, but yeah, I think for a 499 tablet, it settles nicely into the mid-range. well, actually, here we go. quick little update. I just got an email back saying Google will be selling the dock separately from the tablet. if you want another one for 130 dollars. think about it like that. it's pretty good value. 500 bucks for the tablet and the dock means you get about 370 for the tablet and 130 for the dock. that's pretty cheap. it's pretty good. I'm curious what you guys are thinking. let me know in the comments if you think you'd be interested in getting one of these. but more importantly, what do you want to see in the full review when we get one here and test everything? because we're gonna do it? okay, that's been it. thanks for watching peace [Music]."}, {"title": "Google Pixel Fold Impressions! $1800 of Pixel?!", "description": "Google has made an $1800 folding phone.

what's up guys I'm Kim BHD here and\nwelcome to your first look at Google's\nfirst foldable phone it's almost wild\nthat it's finally here and I got to hold\nit and play with it for the first time\nafter all these months of rumors and\nhype so the phone is exactly what it\nsounds like it's a pixel with a folding\nscreen on the inside and we are curious\njust waiting to see what it would look\nlike just because this is the official\nGoogle take on what a folding Android\nphone would look like so now we've got\nit so for a phone like this there's\nbasically three categories that matter\ndesign hardware specs and software\nand I guess also probably price but\nwe'll get to that at the end because\nthat's also important it's an expensive\nphone but with my like hours of Hands-On\ntime with the phone I did get a pretty\ngood sense of all three of these things\nso for Design This is a more compact\nfolding phone I would say it's in the\nsame style as the Oppo Find N2 but a\nlittle bigger and a little thinner so\nthere's a 5.8 inch OLED display on the\noutside pretty thin bezels power button\nand fingerprint reader and volume\nbuttons on the side and there's a pretty\nfirm hinge that can stop at just about\nany angle to hold the phone open for\neasel mode but then this is where it\ngets interesting Google made a pretty\nbig design choice in the hinge mechanism\nto put a lot of the parts of the folding\nHardware above and below the middle\ninstead of behind it so that's what\nmakes the hinge itself and the entire\nphone so thin but that also means\nthere's extra Hardware now above and\nbelow the hinge so when you open up the\nphone yes that means there's a bit more\nbezel than usual above and below the\ndisplay now it's a pretty generous 7.6\ninch display unfolding on the inside\nhere but I think that it it'll be\nslightly controversial because people\nare going to freak out about the bezels\nthat's like one of the things you can\ncount on for the internet but honestly\nlooking at it and using it I'm totally\nfine with it like it lets them put an\nactually good front facing camera and\nthe bezel on the inside here and it\ngives you a bit of something to hold on\nto and rest your thumb when you're\nholding the phone open anyway around the\nback is the camera bar that doesn't\nquite span the whole width of the back\nbut it still looks very pixel Plus on\nthe side there's an LED flash and a\nmicrophone array and it comes in two\ncolors basically black and white\nhonestly I think it's a pretty good\nlooking phone I'm someone who liked the\nlooks of the older pixels so that falls\nright in line with that and I keep going\nback to this Oppo Find N2 this is a\nphone whose form factor I've loved so\nmuch and the pixel is both a little\nbigger and a little thinner which is\nreally interesting and we're gonna have\nto see how this thinness trade-off pays\noff because that naturally means not so\nmuch battery right so let's we'll get to\nthe next category let's talk about the\nnext section of things which is just\nhardware specs so the story of the\nhardware here is a it's mostly Flagship\nor just short of it so the 5.8 inch\ndisplay on the outside is a 1080p 120\nhertz OLED with over 1500 nits Peak\nbrightness which is great and the 7.6\ninch OLED on the inside is also 120\nhertz it's also just over 1440p and this\n6x5 aspect ratio I think these screens\nare awesome but then on the inside\nyou've got tensor G2 which has been in\nthe pixel for several months now and 12\ngigs of RAM and then there's a\n4821 milliamp hour battery inside now\njust for context that's an interesting\nnumber 4800 that would make it the\nlargest battery we've ever seen in a\nfoldable but at the same time\nuh the pixel 7 Pro has a 5000 milliamp\nhour battery and the same tensor G2 and\naverage battery life I think we can say\nand so having a smaller battery and a\nmuch bigger brighter screen in this\npixel fold does give me some pause about\nbattery life that's that's a question uh\nthat I have to actually use it to find\nout and review it but I think also\nwireless charging good to see but it's\nalso kind of slow wired charging 30\nWatts Max and then with the triple\ncameras at the back there's actually all\nnew sensors throughout here which Google\nsays are Flagship grade but we're\ndefinitely going to have to test these\nout for the full review but we're\nlooking at a 48 megapixel main camera\nthen a 10 megapixel Ultra wide and a 10\nmegapixel 5x telephoto so overall as a\npackage teetering on Flagship but not\ncompletely maxed out obviously you know\nthe displays I think looked really\nreally good in person super smooth super\nbright and responsive but there are\nclearly concerns I think the battery is\nthe big question in my head which is\nalways just going to be a combination of\nphysical capacity but also software\noptimizations and so of course software\nis a big part of what makes phone good\nespecially in a folding phone because\nit's a phone and also a tablet at the\nsame time so this pixel fold is going to\nhave all the pixel stuff you know the\nGoogle Assistant now playing hold for me\nmaterial U the customizable looking\nversion of Android that we've seen in\nthe pixels that make it the smartest\nsmartphone in the world and I love all\nthat but of course on the inside screen\nwe're talking about basically a tablet\nand Android tablets let's be real have\nalways been a little bit lacking in a\nsoftware department so I was curious to\nsee if there was new stuff here and\nthere is some stuff to pay attention to\nso first of all the expected stuff like\nside-by-side multitasking feels really\nsmooth and intuitive the apps resize\nhowever you want them but that's not new\nwhat's new is this dock Behavior at the\nbottom so you can now long press that\nbar at the bottom of Android that's\nnormally for gestures and it brings up a\ndock of apps which I think I need to\nplay with more to understand better but\nI'm gonna guess it's your most recent\napps and it's not fully customizable but\nwe'll see either way you can quickly\nlaunch and bounce around other apps here\nand jump right into split screen\nmultitasking just like what Samsung did\nwith the permanent dock on the fold it's\njust this one takes up less space and\nalso during my time with the phone I was\nsort of talking with some people on\nGoogle's team about it and they talked a\nbig game about optimization which I feel\nlike we hear this story a lot but\nthey've worked with a lot of developers\non optimizing tablet versions of their\napps to look good on the pixel fold\nthey're also launching a tablet so that\nshould help both devices and also\nthey've updated something like 50 Google\napps to all work on the larger display\nwhether that's a column layout or just\nsomething that takes advantage of the\nentire display instead of just looking\nlike a stretched phone version of the\napp so I think good news on the software\nTBD when we test it decent Hardware\noverall and I think a pretty nice design\nbut then of course we should get to the\nprice which I mentioned at the beginning\nI felt like it would kind of overshadow\nthe whole thing which is how crazy it is\nbut this phone will cost\n1799 dollars\nis an 1800 phone and 1800 bucks is a lot\nfor a phone that's at the top of the\nmarket I'm pretty sure that's the exact\nsame price that Samsung's fold 4\nlaunched at but now that's probably\ndropped in price since it came out so I\nmean we're this is going to bring\ncomparisons to every other 1800 folding\nphone option so if I'm just guessing\nfrom my first impressions this is going\nto be a tough sell for anyone who isn't\nspecifically interested in the pixel\nsoftware experience which to be fair I'm\none of those people I love that but it's\nthe same tough cell that the pixel 7 Pro\nwas but at least this was sort of\nundercutting some of the most expensive\nlike Ultra phones out there where this\npixel fold is the same price as the most\nexpensive best Flagship folding phones\nbut all in all very interesting very\ninteresting Google's first entry into\nthe folding phone space definitely get\nsubscribed to this channel so you can\nsee the full review when I actually get\nmy hands on this phone for a longer\nperiod of time and test it but for now\nthat's your first look let me know what\nyou think is this gonna be able to sell\nat this price or is this just another\none first option in the

I think these screens are awesome. but then on the inside you've got tensor G2, which has been in the pixel for several months now, and 12 gigs of RAM, and then there's a 4821 milliamp hour battery inside. now, just for context, that's an interesting number. 4800, that would make it the largest battery we've ever seen in a foldable. but at the same time, uh, the pixel 7 Pro has a 5000 milliamp hour battery and the same tensor, G2 and average battery life, I think we can say. and so having a smaller battery and a much bigger, brighter screen in this pixel fold does give me some pause about battery life. that's. that's a question, uh, that I have to actually use it to find out and review it. but I think also wireless charging- good to see, but it's also kind of slow- wired charging, 30 Watts Max. and then with the triple cameras at the back, there's actually all new sensors throughout here which Google says are Flagship grade, but we're definitely going to have to test these out for the full review. but we're looking at a 48 megapixel main camera, then a 10 megapixel Ultra wide and a 10 megapixel 5x telephoto. so overall as a package teetering on Flagship, but not completely maxed out. obviously, you know the displays, I think looked really really good in person: super smooth, super bright and responsive. but there are clearly concerns. I think the battery is the big question in my head which is always just going to be a combination of physical capacity but also software optimizations, and so, of course, software is a big part of what makes phone good, especially in a folding phone, because it's a phone and also a tablet at the same time. so this pixel fold is going to have all the pixel stuff- you know, the Google Assistant now playing hold for me, material U, the customizable looking version of Android that we've seen in the pixels, that make it the smartest smartphone in the world, and I love all that. but of course, on the inside screen, we're talking about basically a tablet, and Android tablets, let's be real, have always been a little bit lacking in a software department, so I was curious to see if there was new stuff here, and there is some stuff to pay attention to. so, first of all, the expected stuff like side-by-side multitasking feels really smooth and intuitive. the apps resize however you want them, but that's not new. what's new is this dock Behavior at the bottom, so you can now long press that bar at the bottom of Android. that's normally for gestures, and it brings up a dock of apps which I think I need to play with more to understand better, but I'm gonna guess it's your most recent apps and it's not fully customizable, but we'll see. either way, you can quickly launch and bounce around other apps here and jump right into split screen multitasking, just like what Samsung did with the permanent dock on the fold. it's just: this one takes up less space. and also during my time with the phone I was sort of talking with some people on Google's team about it and they talked a big game about optimization, which I feel like we hear this story a lot. but they've worked with a lot of developers on optimizing tablet versions of their apps to look good on the pixel fold. they're also launching a tablet, so that should help both devices. and also they've updated something like 50 Google apps to all work on the larger display, whether that's a column layout or just something that takes advantage of the entire display instead of just looking like a stretched phone version of the app. so I think, good news on the software TBD when we test it, decent Hardware overall and I think a pretty nice design. but then of course, we should get to the price which I mentioned at the beginning. I felt like it would kind of overshadow the whole thing, which is how crazy it is. but this phone will cost 1799 dollars is an 1800 phone and 1800 bucks is a lot for a phone that's at the top of the market. I'm pretty sure that's the exact same price that Samsung's fold 4 launched at, but now that's probably dropped in price since it came out. so I mean we're this is going to bring comparisons to every other 1800 folding phone option. so if I'm just guessing from my first impressions, this is going to be a tough sell for anyone who isn't specifically interested in the pixel software experience, which, to be fair, I'm one of those people. I love that. but it's the same tough cell that the pixel 7 Pro was. but at least this was sort of undercutting some of the most expensive like Ultra phones out there, where this pixel fold is the same price as the most expensive, best Flagship folding phones. but all in all, very interesting, very interesting. Google's first entry into the folding phone space. definitely get subscribed to this channel so you can see the full review when I actually get my hands on this phone for a longer period of time and test it. but for now that's your first look. let me know what you think. is this gonna be able to sell at this price or is this just another one, first option in the first gen pile that people probably shouldn't buy. let me know what you think. thanks for watching. get to the next one: peace [Music] foreign."}, {"title": "Google Pixel 7A Review: New Price!", "description": "The price went up, as part of Google's new strategy.

think it's an intentional leak\nand oh they're they're letting stuff get\nout about their phone so that's free\npress no I think they're just bad at it\nlike really really bad at it so\neverything about the phone is already\nout before it even comes out\nthat's just the way it is with pixel\nphones now pixel anything\nanyway this is the pixel 7A you've\nprobably heard about it or seen some\nthings uh and it turns out pretty much\neverything you've seen is true because\nit's a pixel but really what you should\nknow is this is the new mid-ranger from\nGoogle and it's a bit more expensive\nthan the previous one 7A costs 499 and\nit's very similar to the pixel 7. let's\ntalk about it so first things first yes\nthe price did go up the pixel 6A was 449\nthat release this is the 7A so there\nshould be a good reason to add 50 more\ndollars so let's just start with what's\nnew which is wireless charging and a new\n90 Hertz display honestly these are\nwelcome features wireless charging is a\nnice one for convenience I will say it's\ndefinitely not fast wireless charging\nit's only seven and a half Watts here so\nI've noticed literally when I'm\nnavigating and this is wireless charging\nin my car and it's got high brightness\nGPS stuff going it just holds its charge\nit doesn't lower or go up it just stays\nthe same but hey if you have a wireless\ncharger sitting around at the desk at\nwork or at the bedside or something like\nthat it'll definitely be good for a\ntrickle charge overnight which not every\nphone in this price range can say they\nhave so that's good and then the 90\nHertz display is a funny one because\nit's actually off by default on this\nphone like when you first take it out\nthe box and start using it it's a 60\nhertz phone but you can go into the\ndisplay settings and turn turn on smooth\ndisplay suddenly it's 50 percent more\nframes and it's dramatically smoother\nabout as smooth as the pixel 7 was it's\nalso the same tensor G2 chip and the\nsame 8 gigs of RAM so performance feels\npretty similar to the pixel 7 at 90\nHertz it makes a big difference I do not\nenjoy using this phone at 60 hertz for\nthis price it did seem a little bit\nchoppier like it was dropping frames and\nactually operating at 45 to 55 Hertz so\nyeah turn on that 90 Hertz build quality\nwise that is where you'll see at least\non paper it does take the small step\ndown from the pixel 7. uh\nplastic back and the the rails are still\nmetal which is nice and it is also IP67\ninstead of ip68 but honestly you'd be\nhard-pressed to notice just like using\nthis phone holding it there's no\ncreaking no bending no nothing screams\nlow quality about this build at all so I\nthink that was well done and this is a\nslightly smaller 6.1 inch flat display\nstill 1080P and it's up to 90 Hertz like\nI said and it does have some serious\ncolor shifting and banding when you get\noff axis but honestly you know it's\nstill bright it still looks good enough\nfor this price it's Gorilla Glass 3 and\nalso even though the display is slightly\nsmaller the slightly thicker bezels just\nbring it right back up to basically the\nsame size of a phone as the pixel 7. so\nit feels like another fair trade and\nthen there is a new set of colors this\nThis little light blue is called c as in\nOcean it's the C but there's also a\ncharcoal and snow which are the black\nand white ones and there's also a red\nlike coral colored one that one is an\nonline only Google Store color pretty\nfire actually but you know Channel\nsponsored dbrand will let you spice it\nup I've never actually shouted out the\nJerry rig everything tear down skin\nbecause usually dbrand has to wait for\nsomeone to actually do the tear down\nluckily though they were able to pull\nsome strings and get this one made ahead\nof time so it's ready right for launch\nand this is a rare first look at the\ninside of the phone on camera through\nthis skin and it's it's 15 off too along\nwith everything else on their site right\nnow for you guys as long as you go to\ndbrand.com MKBHD and use code everything\nbut bottom line it still very much looks\nlike a pixel the metal wraparound visor\nthe pill cut out for the cameras the\nantenna bands in the right places the\nslot speakers the buttons are still very\nclicky I mean if this is they've done\nthe hardware well this is a very good\ntrade-off for the hardware price and\nthen do I really even need to get into\nthe software because this story kind of\nwrites itself they do all the same\nsoftware stuff in the a series phones as\nthey do on the more premium pixels which\nI like not everybody does that so all\nthe same features all the same stuff\nthat I like about every other pixel is\nalso here I've called the pixel the\nsmartest smartphone in the world because\nof how good Google assistant is how good\nthe voice to text is with all the\non-device transcription the incredible\nvoice recorder app the Google Assistant\nstuff that screens calls and waits on\nhold for me the now playing feature that\nhears songs in the background wherever\nyou go and identifies them for you the\nmaterial you stuff throughout everything\nthat identifies your wallpaper and\nmatches your system colors to it and of\ncourse the promised three years of\nsoftware updates which hilariously isn't\nthe longest promise support in the\nindustry anymore that actually goes to\nSamsung's phones which promise like four\nto five years of support but\nnevertheless no surprises here so really\nmy only two question marks when I got\nthis phone were battery and cameras so\nbattery would be kind of interesting\nbecause it's roughly the same size\nbattery as the pixel 7 so would it have\nthe same battery life or not but then\nalso cameras because For the first time\nin a while there's new cameras in here\nall new cameras that we've never seen in\na pixel before so a departure from the\ntried and true so first for battery 4\n385 milliamp hours 18 watt charging kind\nof slow and seven and a half watt\nwireless charging even slower and then\ntotal battery life I'm gonna say average\nat best so it's a full day of use but\ndefinitely nothing more even at 90 Hertz\nwhich is fine you know it's mid-range so\nI got quite a few days with the the\nthree to four hours of screen on time at\n90 Hertz with my typical usage and I'd\nhave like 10 left at the end of the day\nso I'm not really worried about it dying\nbefore the end of the day unless it's\ncrazy heavy but even then the wireless\ncharging can kind of save you if you\nwant to prolong its death a little bit\nwe'll see how this ages over time but\nfor now I'm giving it a c plus battery\nlife if that makes sense but let's talk\nabout these cameras okay so pixel 6A\nlast year played it super safe with the\ncameras because it used the same 12\nmegapixel sensor from the previous like\nfour years of pixels in a row that\nInfamous IMX 363 sensor that did so well\nthis one has a brand new 64 megapixel\nmain camera paired with a 13 megapixel\nUltra wide and a 13 megapixel selfie\ncamera so when I first started testing\nit I mean I'm thinking all right well\nthis new sensor keep up with the old\ntried and true pixel 6A because we all\nknow how good those old cameras were but\npretty quickly it became clear that\nGoogle has done the work to tighten up\nthe processing with the new sensor and\nactually sort of match it this time and\ntake advantage of the actual larger\nsensor so it's not just about the\nmegapixel count matter of fact this 64\nmegapixel sensor bins down to 16\nmegapixels by default every time and\nthere is no way in Google's app to take\nfull 64 megapixel photos but it's more\nabout the larger size of the sensor\nwhich can bring in more light and give a\nmore shallow natural depth of field so\nyeah pixel photos look pretty good for a\n500 phone there are tons of dynamic\nrange without being too hdre and\nactually kind of feels like they've\nevened it out a little bit so it's a\nlittle less contrasty but it still has\nthat famous contrasty pixel look and\nthen that F 1.9 Max aperture combined\nwith the new sensor means you can take\nclose-ups of things and have a really\nshallow depth of field and you can take\nbetter low-light photos with faster\nshutter speeds at night with night sight\nthere is no macro mode I noticed but you\ncan get pretty close up probably I'm\ngonna say like five inches away from the\nsubject and still be fine not too much\nfringing\nthe ultra wide here has a lot of the\nsame characteristics but it's\nparticularly distorted and warped at the\ncorners I feel like this this is\nsomething like I would expect Google to\nimprove more with their software maybe\nthey'll update this over time but for\nnow the Distortion look is pretty\nnoticeable but it is wide and then the\nSelfies they look like pixel selfies\nhonestly very solid no complaints tons\nof range that's a good selfie camera for\nvideo you can do 4K 60 from the main\ncamera which the Samsung a54 I just\ntested I don't think could even do that\nbut then it's 4K 30 from the other\ncameras which is fine looks normal\nit this is a top three mid-range\nsmartphone camera but hold on to that\nthought all the rest of the little parts\nof this phone I've tested were right in\nline for this price the haptics were\npretty good not as good as the more\nexpensive pixels but pretty good the\noptical fingerprint reader is just a\nbeat slower than the super fast\nultrasonic ones but none of the pixels\nhave particularly fast fingerprint\nreaders anyway so this is par for the\ncourse and when the sun hit it I could\nalso see that it was slightly angled to\nthe right not sure if that's normal or\nnot I just know I haven't seen it like\nthat before but let's be real here for\nthe a series it all comes down to the\nprice point and this one has gone up so\nit is still mid-range but it's like\nupper like premium mid-range at 500\nbucks Verizon is also going to sell a\nmillimeter wave version and theirs will\nbe 550 bucks classic Verizon but still\npremium mid-range right this is a good\nphone and I think a lot of people will\nget it and really like it but for the\nprice I would actually rather go for the\npixel 7. it is six months older yes than\nthis brand new a series phone but it's\ngonna have the same specs it's the same\ntensor chip and same RAM and everything\nbut it will have more capable cameras on\nthe back and the front a faster 20 watt\nwireless charging and then a bunch of\nthe smaller little things better haptics\nbetter speakers and a cheaper phone it's\nactually glass on the back like there's\njust a bunch of little things that add\nup to a better experience overall it's\nthinner bezels better accessories\nbecause it's six months old already it's\nalso ip68 instead of IP67 and this phone\nis like 5.99 standard and it was when it\ncame out but it's regularly on sale for\nmuch less than that if you can get this\nphone pixel 7 for in the 500 to 550\nrange I would take this over the 7A but\nI guess that's just the middle child\neffect because Google is now trying this\nsort of newer thing where they're\noffering more things at once more pixels\nfor different prices they're keeping the\n6A in the lineup at 349 which I think is\na really good deal and so now you can\nget a pixel anywhere from 350 bucks to\n1800 bucks\nchoice is yours 7A is kind of right in\nthe middle let me know what you think\nabout this phone and whether or not\nyou'd get this or the older seven in the\nmeantime thanks for watching check out\nall the new stuff on the channel if you\nhaven't already and I'll catch you guys\nin the next one peace\n", "punctuated_text": "[Music]. first of all, can we talk about something for a second? Google is the worst company on Earth at keeping things a secret, and I don't think it's on purpose, like some people think it's an intentional leak, and oh they're, they're letting stuff get out about their phone, so that's free press. no, I think they're just bad at it, like really, really bad at it. so everything about the phone is already out before it even comes out. that's just the way it is with pixel phones- now pixel anything. anyway, this is the pixel 7A. you've probably heard about it or seen some things, uh, and it turns out pretty much everything you've seen is true, because it's a pixel. but really, what you should know is this is the new mid-ranger from Google and it's a bit more expensive than the previous one. 7A costs 499 and it's very similar to the pixel 7.. let's talk about it. so, first things first. yes, the price did go up. the pixel 6A was 449 that release. this is the 7A, so there should be a good reason to add 50 more dollars. so let's just start with what's new, which is wireless charging and a new 90 Hertz display. honestly, these are welcome features. wireless charging is a nice one, for convenience I will say it's definitely not fast wireless charging. it's only seven and a half Watts here. so I've noticed literally when I'm navigating- and this is wireless charging in my car and it's got high brightness GPS stuff going- it just holds its charge, it doesn't lower or go up, it just stays the same. but hey, if you have a wireless charger sitting around at the desk at work or at the bedside or something like that, it'll definitely be good for a trickle charge overnight, which not every phone in this price range can say they have. so that's good. and then the 90 Hertz display is a funny one because it's actually off by default on this phone, like when you first take it out the box and start using it. it's a 60 hertz phone but you can go into the display settings and turn, turn on smooth display. suddenly it's 50 percent more frames and it's dramatically smoother- about as smooth as the pixel 7 was. it's also the same tensor G2 chip and the same 8 gigs of RAM. so performance feels pretty similar to the pixel 7 at 90 Hertz. it makes a big difference. I do not enjoy using this phone at 60 hertz for this price. it did seem a little bit choppier, like it was dropping frames and actually operating at 45 to 55 Hertz. so, yeah, turn on that 90 Hertz. build quality wise, that is where you'll see, at least on paper, it does take the small step down from the pixel 7.. uh, plastic back and the the rails are still metal, which is nice, and it is also IP67 instead of ip68. but honestly, you'd be hard-pressed to notice, just like using this phone, holding it, there's no creaking, no bending, no, nothing screams low quality about this build at all. so I think that was well done. and this is a slightly smaller, 6.1 inch flat display, still 1080P, and it's up to 90 Hertz, like I said, and it does have some serious color shifting and banding when you get off axis, but honestly, you know it's still bright, it still looks good enough for this price. it's Gorilla Glass 3 and also, even though the display is slightly smaller, the slightly thicker bezels just bring it right back up to basically the same size of a phone as the pixel 7.. so it feels like another fair trade. and then there is a new set of colors. this, This little light blue, is called c, as in Ocean it's the C, but there's also a charcoal and snow, which are the black and white ones, and there's also a red like coral colored one. that one is an online only Google Store color. pretty fire actually, but you know, Channel sponsored dbrand will let you spice it up. I've never actually shouted out the Jerry rig, everything, tear down skin, because usually dbrand has to wait for someone to actually do the tear down. luckily, though, they were able to pull some strings and get this one made ahead of time, so it's ready, right for launch. and this is a rare first look at the inside of the phone on camera through this skin, and it's it's 15 off too, along with everything else on their site right now. for you guys, as long as you go to dbrandcom MKBHD and use code everything but bottom line, it still very much looks like a pixel. the metal wraparound visor, the pill cut out for the cameras, the antenna bands in the right places, the slot speakers, the buttons are still very clicky. I mean, if this is, they've done the hardware well, this is a very good trade-off for the hardware price. and then do I really even need to get into the software, because this story kind of writes itself? they do all the same software stuff in the a series phones as they do on the more premium pixels, which I like. not everybody does that. so all the same features, all the same stuff that I like about every other pixel is also here. I've called the pixel the smartest smartphone in the world because of how good Google assistant is, how good the voice to text is, with all the on-device transcription, the incredible voice recorder app, the Google Assistant stuff that screens, calls and waits on hold for me, the now playing feature that hears songs in the background wherever you go and identifies them for you, the material you stuff throughout, everything that identifies your wallpaper and matches your system colors to it. and, of course, the promised three years of software updates, which, hilariously, isn't the longest promise support in the industry anymore. that actually goes to Samsung's phones, which promise like four to five years of support, but nevertheless, no surprises here. so really my only two question marks when I got this phone were battery and cameras. so battery would be kind of interesting because it's roughly the same size battery as the pixel 7, so would it have the same battery life or not? but then also cameras, because For the first time in a while there's new cameras in here, all new cameras that we've never seen in a pixel before. so a departure from the tried and true. so first for battery: 4, 385 milliamp hours, 18 watt charging- kind of slow- and seven and a half watt wireless charging- even slower- and then total battery life, I'm gonna say average at best. so it's a full day of use, but definitely nothing more, even at 90 Hertz, which is fine, you know, it's mid-range. so I got quite a few days with the, the three to four hours of screen on time at 90 Hertz with my typical usage, and I'd have like 10 left at the end of the day. so I'm not really worried about it dying before the end of the day, unless it's crazy heavy. but even then the wireless charging can kind of save you if you want to prolong its death a little bit. we'll see how this ages over time, but for now I'm giving it a c plus battery life, if that makes sense. but let's talk about these cameras, okay. so pixel 6A last year played it super safe with the cameras because it used the same 12 megapixel sensor from the previous- like four years of pixels in a row- that Infamous IMX 363 sensor that did so well. this one has a brand new 64 megapixel main camera paired with a 13 megapixel Ultra wide and a 13 megapixel selfie camera. so when I first started testing it I mean I'm thinking, all right, well, this new sensor keep up with the old, tried and true pixel 6A, because we all know how good those old cameras were. but pretty quickly it became clear that Google has done the work to tighten up the processing with the new sensor and actually sort of match it this time and take advantage of the actual larger sensor. so it's not just about the megapixel count- matter of fact, this 64 megapixel sensor bins down to 16 megapixels by default every time and there is no way in Google's app to take full 64 megapixel photos- but it's more about the larger size of the sensor, which can bring in more light and give a more shallow natural depth of field. so yeah, pixel photos look pretty good for a 500 phone. there are tons of dynamic range without being too hdre and actually kind of feels like they've evened it out a little bit. so it's a little less contrasty, but it still has that famous contrasty pixel look. and then that F 1.9 Max aperture, combined with the new sensor, means you can take close-ups of things and have a really shallow depth of field and you can take better low-light photos with faster shutter speeds at night with night sight. there is no macro mode, I noticed, but you can get pretty close up- probably- I'm gonna say like five inches away from the subject and still be fine, not too much fringing. the ultra wide here has a lot of the same characteristics, but it's particularly distorted and warped at the corners. I feel like this. this is something like I would expect Google to improve more with their software. maybe they'll update this over time, but for now the Distortion look is pretty noticeable, but it is wide. and then the Selfies: they look like pixel selfies. honestly very solid, no complaints, tons of range. that's a good selfie camera. for video you can do 4K 60 from the main camera, which the Samsung a54 I just tested- I don't think could even do that. but then it's 4K 30 from the other cameras, which is fine. looks normal it. this is a top three mid-range smartphone camera. but hold on to that thought. all the rest of the little parts of this phone I've tested were right in line for this price. the haptics were pretty good, not as good as the more expensive pixels, but pretty good. the optical fingerprint reader is just a beat slower than the super fast ultrasonic ones, but none of the pixels have particularly fast fingerprint readers anyway. so this is par for the course. and when the sun hit it, I could also see that it was slightly angled to the right. not sure if that's normal or not, I just know. I haven't seen it like that before. but let's be real here. for the a series, it all comes down to the price point, and this one has gone up. so it is still mid-range, but it's like upper, like premium mid-range at 500 bucks. Verizon is also going to sell a millimeter wave version and theirs will be 550 bucks, classic Verizon, but still premium, mid-range. right. this is a good phone and I think a lot of people will get it and really like it. but for the price I would actually rather go for the pixel 7.. it is six months older, yes, than this brand new a series phone, but it's gonna have the same specs. it's the same tensor chip and same RAM and everything. but it will have more capable cameras on the back and the front, a faster 20 watt wireless charging and then a bunch of the smaller little things: better haptics, better speakers and a cheaper phone. it's actually glass on the back, like there's just a bunch of little things that add up to a better experience overall. it's thinner bezels, better accessories, because it's six months old already. it's also ip68 instead of IP67 and this phone is like 5.99 standard and it was when it came out, but it's regularly on sale for much less than that. if you can get this phone, pixel 7, for in the 500 to 550 range, I would take this over the 7A. but I guess that's just the middle child effect, because Google is now trying this sort of newer thing where they're offering more things at once, more pixels for different prices. they're keeping the 6A in the lineup at 349, which I think is a really good deal, and so now you can get a pixel anywhere from 350 bucks to 1800 bucks. choice is yours. 7A is kind of right in the middle. let me know what you think about this phone and whether or not you'd get this or the older seven in the meantime.

cheap because it\nwas true for a while there but then we\nstarted getting these more and more\nexpensive Flagship phones they broke\nthrough this thousand dollar price\nbarrier we've got super expensive phones\nnow so I can no longer stand by the\nsecond half of that statement\nbut the first half\nstill pretty compelling and so this is\nthe Samsung Galaxy a54 which just came\nout pretty recently and represents\nroughly the middle-ish of Samsung's\nlineup where they've got phones at every\nprice from like 160 bucks all the way up\nto nearly two thousand dollars and this\none actually has a great case to be the\nbest value in the entire lineup I didn't\nexpect to say that but I'm saying it now\nbecause I've been using this phone for\nthe past two weeks and it actually\ndelivers very well on a lot of the\npremium smartphone experience but at\nliterally a third of the price of the\nflagship from the same company literally\nthis phone MSRP is like 400 450 bucks\nright now\nyou sign the right contract in the US\nyou can basically get it for free and\nthe flagship that I've been daily\ndriving for like the first half of this\nyear so far is the s23 ultra which\nretails for twelve hundred dollars still\nso what I wanted to find out and show\nyou in this video is how close does this\na54 get to this s23 Ultra or any of\nthese Mega flagships that are like it\nbecause it's definitely not a third of\nthe functionality so I'm breaking this\ndown into five categories because these\nare my five pillars of a great\nsmartphone build quality display\nperformance camera and battery so I've\nsaid before if a smartphone can nail all\nfive of these things then it's a good\nphone period And as a product goes down\nin price then you naturally expect it to\nstart to make some sacrifices in some of\nthese areas so right from the top with\nbuild quality it gets interesting\nbecause Samsung kind of adopted this\nthing where they use essentially the\nsame design language across their entire\nlineup to keep it consistent and\nrecognizable by but that also basically\nmeans that this 1200 phone does not look\ndramatically different from this 400 to\n450 phone Samsung is one of these\ncompanies that only does the satin slash\nmatte finish on the backs of their most\npremium phones and so the squared off\nrails on the s23 ultra are a polished\naluminum for contrast the a54 on the\nother hand is the other way around it's\nglossy glass on the back and it's a more\nSatin finish on the aluminum rails and I\nkind of like that too at the end of the\nday though they're literally both glass\nand aluminum and so really it comes down\nto two main differences between the two\none is the size they only come in these\nsizes and so this a54 is definitively\nsmaller and lighter than the ultra and\ntwo it's flat and that's totally fine\nwhere the ultra does have this little\nbit of a curve on the sides of the\ndisplay but to be honest yeah build\nquality is very close here it is IP67\nversus ip68 which by definition is\nalmost the same thing and the a54 puts\nthe SIM card slot plus a expandable\nstorage at the top where the flagship\njust has a SIM card tray at the bottom\nwith no expandable storage if I can\nsafely assume that both Gorilla Glass 5\nand Gorilla Glass vectus 2 both scratch\nat a level six with deeper grooves at a\nlevel seven I feel pretty comfortable\nsaying that the a54 is 90 of the build\nquality of the flagship which is a\nreally good start\nso then there's the displays now this is\nSamsung we're talking about here so they\ndefinitely go the extra mile with the\nflagship display no question about that\nit is ridiculously good incredibly\nbright super sharp responsive adaptive\nand efficient I mean every number on\npaper is pretty close to maxed out from\nthe 1440p resolution to the 1750 nits of\nbrightness from an AMOLED panel 120\nhertz Max refresh rate but variable down\nto one Hertz with ltpo I mean it's\npretty awesome so the a54 display is a\nstep down on paper sure and when you\nactually use it you realize that they've\ncut out like the extra bells and\nwhistles the over-the-top stuff that are\nmaybe a little more for The Fringe\nsituations but still keep the screen to\na pretty premium level for 99 of use\ncases so like I said this only comes in\none size so it's a little smaller in the\nflagship but that's also probably a good\nthing for some people because phones are\nhuge so this is a 6.4 inch 1080p flat\nAMOLED this is still over 400 pixels per\ninch so even though it can't do Quad HD\nit's still going to be pretty great for\nmost people that aren't pixel peeping\nlike I am and it's still plenty bright I\nmean I'm looking at this thing it gets\nup to a thousand nits and regularly goes\noutdoors and looks totally fine like in\nthe dashboard of my car and out in the\nsun no problems so in that way it's\npretty close but you can also see the\nbezels all the way around are a little\nbit thicker this is one of those things\nthat tends to get like pointed out in\nYouTube comments more than by people\nactually buying the phone but yeah it's\ntrue it does have slightly bigger bezels\nand a bigger chin it's not completely\ncorner to corner and then while the s23\nultra has the ltpo that can adapt all\nthe way from 120 hertz down to 1 Hertz\nwhen it's not moving this a54 display\ncan adapt from 120 hertz down to 60\nhertz and basically switch back and\nforth so not quite as adaptive and\nefficient but better than nothing and it\ngoes pretty blue off axis more than some\nof the more premium Samsung panels\nalready do and also that hole punch cut\nout as I pointed out before is not quite\nthe little perfect black circle but it\ndoes have this little shiny metal ring\nthat can be slightly distracting when\nthe Sun hits it at just the right angle\nit's a small thing but I gotta mention\nit but yeah they still give you every\nsingle setting in here as the more\nexpensive phone to dial in the display's\ncolors and match what you're looking for\nso overall I'm willing to say the a54\nhas 80 of the display of the flagship\nit's obviously not going to match it on\npaper and in the most bleeding edge\nextreme situations like direct outdoor\nsunlight and things like that then you\ncan see the difference but honestly most\nof the time when you're just using the\nphone especially indoors\nthey look very similar which is pretty\namazing just with slightly thicker\nbezels so then there's performance\nnow this is where you start to get a\nlittle bit of a wider Gap here so you've\nalready heard about the flagship\nSnapdragon 8 Gen 2\n8 gigs of RAM one terabyte of storage\nall that good stuff uh this is working\nwith a lesser chipset here so it's it's\njust not going to be as good so the a54\nis powered by an exynos 1380 chip which\nbenchmarks about 50 to 80 percent lower\nthan the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in CPU it's\nit's a very comfortably mid-range chip\nI'll put it that way for context it's\nputting up similar geekbench scores to\nthe a12 bionic which was in the iPhone\n10s in 2018. so pair this with six gigs\nof RAM and you've got a phone that you\nknow can handle everyday tasks but it\nisn't blowing anything out the water in\nterms of performance and the specs are\nonly part of performance like when I\nwhen I say performance as a pillar\nobviously you want it to be able to open\napps very quickly and be smooth and\nreliable so for normal daily things like\nchecking email or social media scrolling\nor just subscribing to this YouTube\nchannel like it feels just like the\nflagships because it's fine and it's\nalso 120 hertz and it's smooth that\nstuff doesn't require a super high-end\nchip now sure there are few dropped\nframes here and there and it does feel a\nlittle bit different and if you gave me\nthese two phones and didn't tell me\nwhich was which sooner or later I could\ntell you which one was a lower end chip\nbut it would require me starting to push\nyou know some higher end stuff starting\nto multitask starting to flip between a\ncouple heavier apps at once opening and\nclosing a few things when you get to\nlike navigating while streaming music\nover bluetooth you know while reading\nsomething in a web browser on a big\nwebsite stuff like that then the\ndifference is actually really quite\nnoticeable and then the s23 line all has\nthese like Lightning Fast ultrasonic\nfingerprint sensors while the a54 does\nhave an optical sensor which is just a\nbit slower and has to shine a light for\na second instead of the ultrasonic ones\nwhich are more versatile you could also\nargue that built-in storage is going to\nbe faster than expandable although some\npeople just don't care like they just\nwant expandable storage in which case\nthat's actually a benefit for the a54\nbut yeah it's it's pretty clear that the\nperformance difference between Flagship\nchipset and mid-ranger is pretty big\nit's noticeable it's a it's a feel thing\nit's a smoothness thing if you haven't\nused a more expensive phone you might\nnot even notice but that's what it comes\ndown to and especially with the higher\nend tasks\nthese phones are running the same\nsoftware one UI 5.1 but just one\nexecutes the same stuff a little more\nreliably and smoother so I'm going to\ngive a54\n60 of the performance of the flagship\nnot bad so now cameras cameras cameras\ncameras we got all kinds of cameras\ntypically cameras are what separate the\ngood phones from the great phones\nand that's still true so you look at the\nback of the a54 and it looks just like\nall the rest of the s23 series obviously\nnot as many cameras as the ultra but\nwhen you actually hear that this is the\n50 megapixel main camera and this is the\n12 megapixel Ultra wide and this is a 5\nmegapixel macro\nnow you're starting to see where they\nsaved money like in what world do you\nwant a macro camera over a zoom camera\nthis is the obvious version of like\nmaking it look like the more expensive\nphone but saving some money not putting\na zoom but still having something there\nso now the actual photo and video taking\nexperience is the same as the more\nexpensive phones literally it's the same\napp the same UI the same features and\nbuttons so that's fine we can all say\nwhat we want about Samsung's layouts but\nyou know they work they're pretty\nstraightforward and then the photos you\nget in good lighting they seem perfectly\nfine like if you don't compare it to\nsomething super expensive these are all\nsuper passable sharp detailed normal\nlooking photos maybe a little bit blue\nwith the white balance a little bit\nOverexposed but honestly short of the\npixel 6A this is about as good as you'd\nexpect from a 450 phone but of course\nlike I said my goal is to compare it to\nthe super expensive big brothers so when\nyou do that highlights a little more\nsome of the flaws of the a54's main\ncamera which really is just that it\ntends to overexpose and take\nunnecessarily bright shots quite often\nand the white balance is a little\ninconsistent but it's funny there's\nalways this angle always feels weird\nbecause most people buying this phone\nhave never they have they haven't come\nfrom a 1200 phone they don't know what a\n1200 phones\ncapabilities would be so it's like\ncomparing a Toyota Corolla to a Supra\nsure they come from the same company but\nlike people buying the Corolla weren't\ncross shopping with a Supra and they\nweren't even thinking about getting a\nperformance of a Supra so just me\nputting them side by side helps\nhighlight the differences uh but yeah\nthis camera's set is\nfine I think sometimes I boil the camera\nall the way down to like yeah this one's\njust fine but I really mean it it's fine\nlike when you zoom in yeah you lose\nsharpness because you went with a macro\nover a telephoto so it doesn't come\nclose to touching the zoom performance\nof the more expensive phone passed about\nfour or five x the a54 also can't do 8K\nvideo or even 4K 60 like the flagship\ncan but it can do everything else just\nfine and the ultra wide is pretty soft\nas expected especially in lower light\nbut it happens to actually be a tiny bit\nwider than the flagship's ultra wide so\nit's got that going for it you know\nbetween the missing telephotos and the\nLesser compute power\nthis one can go in a bunch of different\ndirections but I'll say the a54 is 70 of\nthe camera for most normal photos of the\nflagship\nwhich is\npretty good but then last but not least\nbattery this one's pretty simple five\nthousand milliamp hours 5000 milliamp\nhours and so it turns out the usable\ndaily battery life of these two phones\nis pretty similar but\nthe thing about the chips though is the\nthe Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which is in a lot\nof the higher end newer phones now is\nit's really good it's it's also it's\nboth more powerful and more efficient uh\nthan the XML so basically this flagship\nphone is capable of way more it's\ncapable of a much higher Peak output and\nso you can actually Spike the usage a\nlot and like run down the battery pretty\nhard if you wanted to but then it's also\nmore efficient so for you know combining\nit with this ltpo display just using it\nevery day regular scrolling social media\nemail hanging out you know this is It's\nSip and Battery it's actually going\nslower through battery than the a54 so\nthe a54 is more of a constant drain it\ndoesn't Spike as high but it doesn't\nhave as good standby time so the the\ncurve of the flagship phone might look\nmore like spiky but the a54 looks more\nlike an even descent if that makes sense\nnow you also do not get wireless char\ncharging with the a54 despite the glass\nback that's one of those features that\nyou sometimes see in phones at this\nprice but it's definitely a common\nemission and the max charging rate is 25\nwatts which is straight up slow in 2023\nbut it's fine it's serviceable there are\nall kinds of phones offering blazing\nfast like 50 80 100 plus watt charging\neven at this lower price point so even\nif the battery isn't amazing you could\nat least top up quickly if you had that\nbut that's not here either so it'll take\nabout an hour to charge from zero to 100\ntotally average but overall it's it's\nnot a substantial weakness especially\nversus the flagship from the same\ncompany which only does 45 Watts so\na54 battery experience is is like 90 of\nthe flagship so if you total up all of\nmy assessments uh and average them out\nover 500 points you get 78 of the\nflagship for a third of the price which\nthat seems like it's pretty clear that\nit's a pretty good deal now there's also\nof course lots of little things that\ndidn't quite fit into those pillars like\nthe slightly better haptics of the\nflagship for example you might be really\ninto that or the bigger speakers that\ncome from having a bigger phone that do\nsound better uh also there's a stylus\nin the big one uh also if you want decks\nyou'd have to pay up because the a54\ndoesn't have that funny thing is they\nboth have the exact same unboxing\nexperience which is just the phone no\ncharger but yeah these mid-rangers today\nmasterfully mitigate the law of\ndiminishing returns\nmatching the flagship's Finesse for a\nfraction of the funds\nthanks for watching\ncatch you guys in the next one peace\n[Music]\n", "punctuated_text": "foreign. so here's the thing I used to be able to say: cheap phones are getting good and good phones are getting cheap, because it was true for a while there, but then we started getting these more and more expensive Flagship phones. they broke through this thousand dollar price barrier. we've got super expensive phones now. so I can no longer stand by the second half of that statement, but the first half still pretty compelling. and so this is the Samsung Galaxy a54, which just came out pretty recently and represents roughly the middle-ish of Samsung's lineup, where they've got phones at every price from like 160 bucks all the way up to nearly two thousand dollars, and this one actually has a great case to be the best value in the entire lineup. I didn't expect to say that, but I'm saying it now because I've been using this phone for the past two weeks and it actually delivers very well on a lot of the premium smartphone experience, but at literally a third of the price of the flagship from the same company. literally, this phone MSRP is like 400- 450 bucks right now you sign the right contract in the US, you can basically get it for free and the flagship that I've been daily driving for like the first half of this year so far is the s23 ultra, which retails for twelve hundred dollars still. so what I wanted to find out and show you in this video is: how close does this a54 get to this s23 Ultra or any of these Mega flagships that are like it? because it's definitely not a third of the functionality. so I'm breaking this down into five categories because these are my five pillars of a great smartphone: build quality, display, performance, camera and battery. so I've said before, if a smartphone can nail all five of these things, then it's a good phone period, And as a product goes down in price, then you naturally expect it to start to make some sacrifices in some of these areas. so, right from the top, with build quality, it gets interesting because Samsung kind of adopted this thing where they use essentially the same design language across their entire lineup to keep it consistent and recognizable by. but that also basically means that this 1200 phone does not look dramatically different from this 400 to 450 phone. Samsung is one of these companies that only does the satin slash matte finish on the backs of their most premium phones, and so the squared off rails on the s23 ultra are a polished aluminum for contrast. the a54, on the other hand, is the other way around. it's glossy glass on the back and it's a more Satin finish on the aluminum rails, and I kind of like that too. at the end of the day, though, they're literally both glass and aluminum, and so really it comes down to two main differences between the two. one is the size. they only come in these sizes, and so this a54 is definitively smaller and lighter than the ultra. and two, it's flat, and that's totally fine, where the ultra does have this little bit of a curve on the sides of the display. but, to be honest, yeah, build quality is very close here. it is IP67 versus ip68, which by definition is almost the same thing, and the a54 puts the SIM card slot plus a expandable storage at the top, where the flagship just has a SIM card tray at the bottom with no expandable storage. if I can safely assume that both Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass vectus 2 both scratch at a level six, with deeper grooves at a level seven, I feel pretty comfortable saying that the a54 is 90 of the build quality of the flagship, which is a really good start. so then there's the displays. now this is Samsung we're talking about here, so they definitely go the extra mile with the flagship display, no question about that. it is ridiculously good, incredibly bright, super sharp, responsive, adaptive and efficient. I mean every number on paper is pretty close to maxed out, from the 1440p resolution to the 1750 nits of brightness from an AMOLED panel, 120 hertz Max refresh rate, but variable down to one Hertz with ltpo. I mean it's pretty awesome. so the a54 display is a step down on paper, sure, and when you actually use it you realize that they've cut out like the extra bells and whistles, the over-the-top stuff that are maybe a little more for The Fringe situations, but still keep the screen to a pretty premium level for 99 of use cases. so, like I said, this only comes in one size, so it's a little smaller in the flagship, but that's also probably a good thing for some people because phones are huge. so this is a 6.4 inch 1080p flat AMOLED. this is still over 400 pixels per inch, so even though it can't do Quad HD, it's still going to be pretty great for most people that aren't pixel peeping, like I am, and it's still plenty bright. I mean, I'm looking at this thing. it gets up to a thousand nits and regularly goes outdoors and looks totally fine, like in the dashboard of my car and out in the sun, no problems. so in that way it's pretty close. but you can also see the bezels all the way around are a little bit thicker. this is one of those things that tends to get like pointed out in YouTube comments more than by people actually buying the phone. but yeah, it's true it does have slightly bigger bezels and a bigger chin. it's not completely corner to corner. and then, while the s23 ultra has the ltpo that can adapt all the way from 120 hertz down to 1 Hertz when it's not moving, this a54 display can adapt from 120 hertz down to 60 hertz and basically switch back and forth. so not quite as adaptive and efficient, but better than nothing. and it goes pretty blue off axis more than some of the more premium Samsung panels already do. and also, that hole punch cut out, as I pointed out before, is not quite the little perfect black circle, but it does have this little shiny metal ring that can be slightly distracting when the Sun hits it at just the right angle. it's a small thing but I gotta mention it. but yeah, they still give you every single setting in here as the more expensive phone to dial in the display's colors and match what you're looking for. so, overall, I'm willing to say the a54 has 80 of the display of the flagship. it's obviously not going to match it on paper and in the most bleeding edge- extreme situations like direct outdoor sunlight and things like that- then you can see the difference. but honestly, most of the time, when you're just using the phone, especially indoors, they look very similar, which is pretty amazing, just with slightly thicker bezels. so then there's performance. now this is where you start to get a little bit of a wider Gap here. so you've already heard about the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2: 8 gigs of RAM, one terabyte of storage, all that good stuff. uh, this is working with a lesser chipset here, so it's it's just not going to be as good. so the a54 is powered by an exynos 1380 chip, which benchmarks about 50 to 80 percent lower than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in CPU it's. it's a very comfortably mid-range chip. I'll put it that way for context. it's putting up similar geekbench scores to the a12 bionic, which was in the iPhone 10s in 2018.. so pair this with six gigs of RAM and you've got a phone that you know can handle everyday tasks, but it isn't blowing anything out the water in terms of performance and the specs are only part of performance, like when I. when I say performance as a pillar, obviously you want it to be able to open apps very quickly and be smooth and reliable. so for normal daily things like checking email or social media scrolling or just subscribing to this YouTube channel, like it feels just like the flagships, because it's fine and it's also 120 hertz and it's smooth, that stuff doesn't require a super high-end chip. now, sure, there are few dropped frames here and there and it does feel a little bit different. and if you gave me these two phones and didn't tell me which was which, sooner or later I could tell you which one was a lower end chip. but it would require me starting to push, you know some higher end stuff, starting to multitask, starting to flip between a couple heavier apps at once, opening and closing a few things. when you get to, like navigating while streaming music over bluetooth, you know, while reading something in a web browser on a big website, stuff like that- then the difference is actually really quite noticeable. and then the s23 line all has these like Lightning Fast, ultrasonic fingerprint sensors, while the a54 does have an optical sensor which is just a bit slower and has to shine a light for a second, instead of the ultrasonic ones, which are more versatile. you could also argue that built-in storage is going to be faster than expandable, although some people just don't care like they just want expandable storage, in which case that's actually a benefit for the a54. but yeah, it's. it's pretty clear that the performance difference between Flagship chipset and mid-ranger is pretty big. it's noticeable, it's a, it's a feel thing, it's a smoothness thing. if you haven't used a more expensive phone, you might not even notice. but that's what it comes down to, and especially with the higher end tasks, these phones are running the same software, one UI 5.1, but just one executes the same stuff a little more reliably and smoother. so I'm going to give a54 60 of the performance of the flagship, not bad. so now cameras, cameras, cameras, cameras. we got all kinds of cameras. typically, cameras are what separate the good phones from the great phones, and that's still true. so you look at the back of the a54 and it looks just like all the rest of the s23 series, obviously not as many cameras as the ultra, but when you actually hear that this is the 50 megapixel main camera and this is the 12 megapixel Ultra wide and this is a 5 megapixel macro. now you're starting to see where they saved money. like in what world do you want a macro camera over a zoom camera? this is the obvious version of like: making it look like the more expensive phone, but saving some money- not putting a zoom, but still having something there. so now the actual photo and video taking experience is the same as the more expensive phones. literally it's the same app, the same UI, the same features and buttons. so that's fine. we can all say what we want about Samsung's layouts, but you know they work. they're pretty straightforward. and then the photos you get: in good lighting they seem perfectly fine, like if you don't compare it to something super expensive, these are all super passable: sharp, detailed, normal looking photos, maybe a little bit blue with the white balance a little bit Overexposed, but honestly, short of the pixel 6A, this is about as good as you'd expect from a 450 phone. but of course, like I said, my goal is to compare it to the super expensive big brothers. so when you do, that highlights a little more some of the flaws of the a54's main camera, which really is just that it tends to overexpose and take unnecessarily bright shots quite often and the white balance is a little inconsistent. but it's funny, there's always. this angle always feels weird because most people buying this phone have never they have, they haven't come from a 1200 phone, they don't know what a 1200 phones capabilities would be. so it's like comparing a Toyota Corolla to a Supra. sure, they come from the same company, but like people buying the Corolla weren't cross shopping with a Supra and they weren't even thinking about getting a performance of a Supra. so just me, putting them side by side helps highlight the differences. uh, but yeah, this camera's set is fine. I think sometimes I boil the camera all the way down to like, yeah, this one's just fine, but I really mean it, it's fine. like when you zoom in, yeah, you lose sharpness because you went with a macro over a telephoto, so it doesn't come close to touching the zoom performance of the more expensive phone passed about four or five x. the a54 also can't do 8K video or even 4K 60, like the flagship can, but it can do everything else just fine. and the ultra wide is pretty soft, as expected, especially in lower light, but it happens to actually be a tiny bit wider than the flagship's ultra wide, so it's got that going for it. you know, between the missing telephotos and the Lesser compute power, this one can go in a bunch of different directions, but I'll say the a54 is 70 of the camera for most normal photos of the flagship, which is pretty good. but then, last but not least, battery. this one's pretty simple: five thousand milliamp hours, 5000 milliamp hours, and so it turns out the usable daily battery life of these two phones is pretty similar. but the thing about the chips, though, is the- the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which is in a lot of the higher end newer phones now, is it's really good? it's. it's. also it's both more powerful and more efficient, uh, than the XML. so, basically, this flagship phone is capable of way more. it's capable of a much higher Peak output, and so you can actually Spike the usage a lot and like run down the battery pretty hard if you wanted to, but then it's also more efficient. so for you know, combining it with this ltpo display, just using it every day, regular scrolling, social media, email hanging out- you know this is It's Sip and Battery- it's actually going slower through battery than the a54, so the a54 is more of a constant drain. it doesn't Spike as high but it doesn't have as good standby time. so the the curve of the flagship phone might look more like spiky, but the a54 looks more like an even descent, if that makes sense. now you also do not get wireless char charging with the a54, despite the glass back. that's one of those features that you sometimes see in phones at this price, but it's definitely a common emission and the max charging rate is 25 watts, which is straight up slow in 2023. but it's fine, it's serviceable. there are all kinds of phones offering blazing fast like 50, 80, 100 plus watt charging, even at this lower price point. so even if the battery isn't amazing, you could at least top up quickly if you had that, but that's not here either. so it'll take about an hour to charge from zero to 100- totally average, but overall it's. it's not a substantial weakness, especially versus the flagship from the same company, which only does 45 Watts. so a54 battery experience is is like 90 of the flagship. so if you total up all of my assessments, uh, and average them out over 500 points, you get 78 of the flagship for a third of the price, which that seems like it's pretty clear that it's a pretty good deal. now there's also, of course, lots of little things that didn't quite fit into those pillars, like the slightly better haptics of the flagship, for example- you might be really into that- or the bigger speakers that come from having a bigger phone that do sound better. uh, also, there's a stylus in the big one. uh, also, if you want decks, you'd have to pay up because the a54 doesn't have that. funny thing is they both have the exact same unboxing experience, which is just the phone, no charger. but yeah, these mid-rangers today masterfully mitigate the law of diminishing returns, matching the flagship's Finesse for a fraction of the funds. thanks for watching. catch you guys in the next one. peace [Music]."}, {"title": "I Made My Own Sneaker!

is\nthe first one it's called m251 why is it\ncalled 251 you might be asking good\nquestion I'm glad you asked so this is\nstill a collaboration after all I could\nhave all the ideas for shoe stuff in the\nworld but I still need someone to build\nthe shoe so Adams is the company that's\ncome through for me on this one they've\nhad their model triple o and then model\n001 they've inhaled some of the most\ncomfortable shoes of all time and I\nagree but this would be something\ncompletely new for both of us the length\nof my first ever YouTube video on Tech\nyeah that one was two minutes and 51\nseconds long\na new beginning\nand that's also sort of a new beginning\n[Music]\nnow if you know me you already knew I\nlike shoes but I'm not suddenly a shoe\ndesigner out of nowhere so the idea was\nthat I would take all sorts of bits and\npieces from different shoes that I like\nshoes that I've worn shoes that I've\nseen and try to combine as many of that\nin one place as I possibly can so the\nlightweightness of nmds uh the\nsilhouette of Jordan Ones things like\nthe the soul and the elastic laces of\nAdam's shoes and the little bits and\ndetails and Tiny things from Blazers and\noff-white collabs and so we went through\na lot of prototypes and a lot of things\nlike that to sort of accomplish that put\nthem all in one place so the process was\nreally fun actually and we went through\nas many combinations as possible and\nwent through a ton of different ideas\nand Designs we're trying to figure out\nwhat was possible and what wasn't in a\nshoe we have a lot of older prototypes\nthat we didn't go with that had things\nlike fitment issues and support issues\nand material issues and we went through\nand basically Adams could tell me like\nthis will be possible versus this won't\nbe possible this will be more expensive\nversus this won't be more expensive and\nso all the different parts of the shoe\nhad to come together from our\ncombination of expertise and my taste it\nwas one of the most fun processes I've\never gone through and then the other\npart of that was I literally got to wear\nthem around and start testing them so\nonce we got working prototypes like this\none I wore for weeks literally started\nshowing up in videos by accident just\nbecause I was just daily driving these\nthings every day testing my own creation\nso we went through dozens of samples\nover two plus years I mean this is a\nlong process where like we have an idea\nfor a YouTube video and we can make that\nin a couple of days this is something\nthat's been in our heads and in the\nbackground for a long time but we\nfinally have come to a final version and\nI really really like it and I'm now\nexcited to like get you guys to actually\nwear it and try it yourselves so now I\ncan review my own product actually I'm\nreally excited for other shoe reviewers\nto be able to do that but what I can do\nis tell you all about it so the\nsilhouette is pretty simple right it's\nnot fully high top but obviously not a\nlow top either it's a really comfortable\ndaily mid and this upper is a combo of\nsynthetic leather and then we actually\nhave a recycled mesh fabric that's a\nnice balance between breathable and\nsupportive and I took a lot of samples\nto get that right and if you're curious\ndevelopment wise this Soul was actually\nthe hardest part so I'm on my feet all\nday my job as a video producer in this\nstudio does involve a lot of walking\nit's a lot of moving around and\ncrouching and kneeling and all kinds of\nstuff like that so Comfort is a high\npriority so this outsole has to be\nsupportive enough to actually function\nand hold up the shoe so it doesn't\ncollapse but also still be soft enough\nthrough the midsole that's really\ncomfortable and this bottom sole is\nproprietary it's all very I don't know\ncamp together super nicely we also did\nsomething a little bit interesting just\nif you see the the shape along the side\nso this is a little bit structural it's\na little Heel To Toe drop so if you're\nused to wearing shoes that are a lot\nflatter like Jays or Converses you will\nnotice and feel a bit of a difference\nwith this shape and it's really good\nthere's a copper lining in here that's\nnaturally antimicrobial which does help\nprevent odors which is awesome my\nsignature and size stamp is on the\ntongue we've got this loop on the back\ntoo which is actually functional and\nthat's where we put the atoms logo which\nis the top one here and the MKBHD\nparallelogram in the same style and of\ncourse the elastic laces underrated a\nlot of people don't know about these but\nyou can sort of just treat them like\nnormal laces maybe tie them a little\nlooser or tighter and then they Flex a\nlittle bit to support your foot as\nyou're moving around\nthere's little details like the New York\nCity Tag the 251 is stitched even um\ntaking it apart even the soul is a\ncustom designed and it

[Music]: I almost can't believe we're finally here. I've reviewed so many products over my Lifetime on YouTube. that's almost ridiculous, and the question always comes up in the background: well, Marquez, when are you gonna make design your own product, right? so two years of materials work and design work and basically a lifetime of inspiration later, I'm actually holding the thing. this is the first one. it's called m251. why is it called 251? you might be asking good question. I'm glad you asked. so this is still a collaboration. after all, I could have all the ideas for shoe stuff in the world, but I still need someone to build the shoe. so Adams is the company that's come through for me on this one. they've had their model triple o and then model 001. they've inhaled some of the most comfortable shoes of all time, and I agree. but this would be something completely new for both of us. the length of my first ever YouTube video on Tech. yeah, that one was two minutes and 51 seconds long. a new beginning. and that's also sort of a new beginning. [Music]. now, if you know me, you already knew I like shoes, but I'm not suddenly a shoe designer out of nowhere. so the idea was that I would take all sorts of bits and pieces from different shoes that I like, shoes that I've worn, shoes that I've seen, and try to combine as many of that in one place as I possibly can. so the lightweightness of nmds, uh, the silhouette of Jordan Ones, things like the, the soul and the elastic laces of Adam's shoes, and the little bits and details and Tiny things from Blazers and off-white collabs, and so we went through a lot of prototypes and a lot of things like that to sort of accomplish that, put them all in one place. so the process was really fun actually, and we went through as many combinations as possible and went through a ton of different ideas and Designs. we're trying to figure out what was possible and what wasn't in a shoe. we have a lot of older prototypes that we didn't go with, that had things like fitment issues and support issues and material issues, and we went through and basically Adams could tell me like this will be possible versus this won't be possible, this will be more expensive versus this won't be more expensive, and so all the different parts of the shoe had to come together. from our combination of expertise and my taste, it was one of the most fun processes I've ever gone through. and then the other part of that was I literally got to wear them around and start testing them. so once we got working, prototypes like this one I wore for weeks literally started showing up in videos by accident, just because I was just daily driving these things every day testing my own creation. so we went through dozens of samples over two plus years. I mean, this is a long process where, like, we have an idea for a YouTube video and we can make that in a couple of days. this is something that's been in our heads and in the background for a long time, but we finally have come to a final version and I really, really like it and I'm now excited to like get you guys to actually wear it and try it yourselves. so now I can review my own product. actually, I'm really excited for other shoe reviewers to be able to do that, but what I can do is tell you all about it. so the silhouette is pretty simple. right, it's not fully high top, but obviously not a low top either. it's a really comfortable daily mid and this upper is a combo of synthetic leather, and then we actually have a recycled mesh fabric that's a nice balance between breathable and supportive and I took a lot of samples to get that right and, if you're curious, development wise, this Soul was actually the hardest part. so I'm on my feet all day. my job as a video producer in this studio does involve a lot of walking. it's a lot of moving around and crouching and kneeling and all kinds of stuff like that. so Comfort is a high priority. so this outsole has to be supportive enough to actually function and hold up the shoe so it doesn't collapse, but also still be soft enough through the midsole. that's really comfortable. and this bottom sole is proprietary. it's all very- I don't know- camp together super nicely. we also did something a little bit interesting, just if you see the the shape along the side. so this is a little bit structural. it's a little Heel To Toe drop. so if you're used to wearing shoes that are a lot flatter, like Jays or Converses, you will notice and feel a bit of a difference with this shape and it's really good. there's a copper lining in here that's naturally antimicrobial, which does help prevent odors, which is awesome. my signature and size stamp is on the tongue. we've got this loop on the back too, which is actually functional, and that's where we put the atoms logo, which is the top one here, and the MKBHD parallelogram in the same style. and, of course, the elastic laces- underrated. a lot of people don't know about these, but you can sort of just treat them like normal laces, maybe tie them a little looser or tighter and then they Flex a little bit to support your foot as you're moving around. there's little details like the New York City Tag, the 251 is stitched, even um, taking it apart, even the soul is a custom designed and it kind of Cups your foot a little bit and is soft as well. all this stuff is awesome. I really couldn't be happier with how these turned out. now, if you get these, you have to promise me one thing: wear your kicks. I I am such like there's this whole culture of like you get shoes and then you have to like baby them and take really good care of them for proper resale value. no, no, you gotta actually daily these and like: wear them out and put them to work. I still get, I still get roasted on Instagram for like crouching down in a picture and then the toe boxes crease and then all the comments are like: what are you doing? you're ruining your shoes. no, wear your kicks, crease your kicks, wear them in all four seasons. I'm gonna be dailying these things. we put a lot of work into the engineering of them to be able to do that. so winter, spring, summer, fall, snow, mud- uh, you'll be able to see mine on social media getting dirty as I wear them a ton. we love that. so I'm gonna make sure these are available as worldwide as we possibly can, and maybe you'll even see me pop up in a retail shop once in a while to help just get the word out about them, and I hope, if you get them, that you wear them too. so this 251 is an exciting New Beginning. also, I've been waiting a long time to do this.

old pieces of tech\naren't really all that interesting like\nwho wants to buy an iPhone 6 right now\nthe number one most sought after piece\nof tech in The Collector world is the\nfactory sealed unopened original iPhone\nnow fun fact back when we went to go\nmake that uh reviewing every single\niPhone video we did have to go back and\nfind and buy a working version of every\nsingle iPhone ever made and the further\nback you go the harder it is to find a\nworking version and we eventually did\nfind a couple like these three original\nused but still working iPhones from\n2007. maybe it's because they're 16\nyears old they are really beat up but\nthe fact that they're still working is\nkind of a miracle finding one that is\noriginal still sealed never been opened\nnever even been touched by human hands\nor seen by human eyes is extremely rare\nit's so rare that I've actually seen\nmany people get scammed by this an\nunopened iPhone is so rare and valuable\nthat people will actually seal a used\noriginal iPhone and sell it online as an\noriginal and man YouTubers have fallen\nvictim to this spending thousands of\ndollars to try to get their hands on\nwhat they thought was going to be an\nuntouched iPhone it's just crazy that\npeople go out scamming like this but hey\nthe difference in value between just any\nold original iPhone and a new sealed\nuntouched iPhone is gigantic and it's\nwell worth the price of the cellophane\nand the heat gun and the effort required\nto make an old iPhone seem new only\nabout 6 million first gen iPhones were\never sold and so of course the number of\nunopened ones will only ever go down\nfrom here and it's sort of this weird\ngame of trying to figure out when their\nvalue has peaked and looking at the\nnumbers it actually feels like it has\npeaked so one actually sold at an\nauction in February this year for over\nsixty thousand dollars which was a\nrecord and the highest we've ever seen\nthen another one appeared at an auction\nin March a month later that one went for\nfifty five thousand dollars then there\nwas one with this lucky you sticker even\nmore rare they probably thought they\nwere going to get the most money for it\nbut it actually went up at an auction a\nfew weeks ago in Chicago and somebody\nscooped it for only forty thousand\ndollars I guess they got a bit of a\ndiscount because that person\nwas me\nand this\nis the package it came in uh because\nthat auction house was not messing\naround it was actually kind of surreal\nwinning this auction just for the record\nit's not like a normal auction site like\nebay.com where you just click a button\nand you win this is an actual auction\nlike a live streamed video of a guy with\na gavel going to get 6000 over here 6500\nin the front row we got 6 800 on the\nphone until we hear seven thousand seven\nthousand here and it just keeps going\nand you can participate from anywhere in\nthe world so they were going through a\nbunch of stuff and the iPhone was item\nnumber 203 and so when they got to 203 I\nlogged into the site and I had my\ninitial offer placed which was the\nminimum of 32 000 the contents have been\nx-rayed verified going once\ngoing twice\nsold to the online bidder moving on I\njust won like that was the moment when I\ncommitted to uh figuring this whole\nthing out and so the rest of the price\nwas just uh sales tax and uh bidding\npremium and shipping which feels like a\nreally good time to say that this video\nis sponsored by\nyou there's a lot of things that we\ncould have spent forty thousand dollars\non like camera equipment for example but\nwe decided to do this and so we've\nbrought back the MKBHD matte black\nwallet it was super limited edition\nbefore but they were very popular so\nwe're bringing them back in a slightly\nless limited edition at shop.mkbhd.com\nthey're also really sick and now I can\nsay that this video is made possible by\nmy wallet the link is below please buy\none\nhave I made a huge mistake\nonly one way to find out but uh it's\ntime to dig into this gigantic crate\n[Music]\nso my biggest question as I get into\nthis is how do I verify if this is\nactually brand new and Untouched by\nhuman hands like on the auction website\nwe did see that there were uh there were\nsome X-rays and the x-rays are cool and\nthey make it feel really official but\nall we really know by seeing those\nx-rays is that the accessories are in\nfact in the Box we don't know if they're\nuntouched\noh and then the other thing about this\nis when you when you put in a serial\nnumber on like Apple's Checker uh you\ncan see that it is not registered so\nwhoever got this phone originally which\nI think they said the name of the\noriginal owner who brought it in uh\nnever registered it it was never used it\nwas never activated but that doesn't\nmean it was never opened so this this is\nvery much uh a trust exercise\nso many layers this is like a Russian\ndoll of\nOG Tech products now this is the one\nwhere I need to be careful I'm a\nprofessional guys it's fine this is fine\nthere it is\nthat is the packaging\nof this brand new\nbut also not so brand new\noriginal iPhone you can see it's got a\nlittle bit of Browning around it I'm not\ntoo put off by that\nand some of the articles that I read\nonline after I bought it were saying\nbasically this break here in the corner\nand uh some other factors are possibly\nwhy it went a little bit lower than the\nrecord sixty thousand dollar price it\nalso has this upside down lucky you\nsticker every article that I've read\nthat I've looked up about this lucky you\nsticker nobody seems to know what it is\nit's kind of confusing because it is\nsuper rare other original sealed iPhones\ndon't have this sticker I even asked\npeople at Apple they don't know what it\nmeans there are so many things I think\npeople forgot about the original iPhone\none is it didn't have an App Store so it\nwas just the apps that were on it and\ntwo you couldn't set a wallpaper with\nthe first version of iOS so everyone's\niPhone looked exactly the same so\nwithout any further ado\nall right\nthis is the moment that all the value\njust went from\nforty thousand to uh\nI don't know depends on how good the\ncondition of the phone is but the\nplastic wrap this 16 year old\nit it does have a smell\noh fancy so they had foam in the top of\nthe boxes and this is the way it showed\nup facing you on the top\nwow I think that is actually\nbrand new\njust a little thing just a nicely\ndesigned\nlittle Factory seal thing oh this is\nharder than a this happened in Justine's\nvideo this is a hard screen protector to\ntake off\nokay so there's a little piece of\nplastic\nhard plastic actually\nthen there is the documents signed\ndesigned by Apple in California I\nactually don't know if there's a sticker\nthis is now all new territory for me\ndespite it being old oh there's more\nthere's a there's a whole microfiber\ninside that says iPhone on it\ninteresting\nfingertips these are all the uh\nthe tips for using and operating your\niPhone in 2007 how to set a passcode how\nto send a message how to browse the web\nand uh oh\nthe stickers are a little bit Askew is\nthat how they were can you see those how\nthey're one of them is upside down and\ntilted the other one's right side up and\ntilted so it kind of it kind of looks on\npurpose but also looks different because\nthey're usually aligned now there is\neven more this is what I was talking\nabout this is what was x-rayed by the\nauction house just to verify that\nthey're here but they're all also still\nsealed in the box so USB a wall brick\nyou also have a 30 pin dock with a\nheadphone jack out on the back this is\nnice let's open those let's open the\ndock\n[Music]\nthat is brand new wow\nit would look like that uh you also get\ntwo more things you get a 30 pin USB a\nto 30 pin charging cable and data cable\nyou plug this into iTunes plug it into\nyour computer and earpods this was back\nin the iconic days of well the\nsilhouette commercials and the white\nheadphones and plugging the wire into\nyour phone that feels very legit I don't\nthink it's going to turn on but I'm\ngonna hold the power button anyway this\nis one of those things where like it's a\n16 year old battery of course it's not\ngoing to turn on that would be a pretty\nred flag actually if it did boot up if\nit okay it doesn't that's good is this\nthis all just feels like exactly what\nthey didn't want me to do when I bought\nthis original iphone look at the\ndifference between\nthat brand new\nfresh piece of metal\nversus one that somebody was out using\nin their everyday lives so while I wait\nfor this a little bit to just probably\ntake a minute to charge but I feel like\nI can say that with all that I know and\nall the research that I've done going\ninto this purchase it seems like this\none is legitimately brand new and\nunopened if anyone can tell me if anyone\nknows or if anyone who's watching this\nworked in Apple retail around the time\nin 2007 when the iPhone was launched\nwhat if this came from Apple or if this\nis something completely different I\nwould love to know because that would be\nreally interesting there's one story\nonline about how it might have been like\na holiday season sticker\nwho knows all right we're back actually\nI'm back the next day hence the\ndifferent shirt and the haircut but\nignore that uh and I want to go over\neverything that I learned because we now\nhave gotten the iPhone to turn on and I\nam convinced that it is an unopened\noriginal and I also learned some things\nabout the iPhone 2. so first of all I am\nconvinced that it's an unopened original\nbecause of this shrink wrap being super\nold because of the shrink wrap that was\naround the iPhone that was inside the\nBox being perfect looking and even the\nfact that it's actually surprisingly\ndifficult to get a 1.0 iPhone to get\npast this uh iTunes boot screen if you\nactually download an old version of\niTunes and plug it in and try to\nactivate it you can get surprisingly far\nand still not actually get it to\nactivate that all sort of lens Credence\nto the fact that we could get other\niPhones to activate because they had\nlater versions of software long story\nshort this is as far as we got with it\nand it does turn on and work the weird\nthing that we found was number one\nthis is the original brick and the\noriginal cable that came with the iPhone\nwe plugged them in overnight we came\nback in the morning and it still didn't\nturn on but when we replaced the brick\nand not the cable\nit actually started to charge second\nthing to learn is there was no SIM card\nejector tool with the iPhone at all but\nwhen you do grab a SIM card injector\ntool and pop open the SIM card tray at\nthe top you will find that there is a\ngigantic SIM card included with the\niPhone so this was a at T slash singular\nexclusive when it came out and look at\nthe size of this SIM card this is the uh\nthe original size SIM card back in the\nday before micro and nano SIM cards but\nthen yeah I did not remember that it\nshipped with this dock until I did my\nresearch and I also didn't know it would\nship with a black microfiber and these\nApple stickers that are slightly Askew\nand this brand new pristine iPhone is\nnow worth dramatically less than what I\npaid for it and that's okay so that'll\nbe it hopefully I don't regret this\nthank you so much for watching and again\nif anyone knows what the lucky you\nsticker means definitely hit us up in\nthe comments or on Twitter\ntalk to you guys in the next one peace\n[Music]\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Applause]\n", "punctuated_text": "all right. in

I guess they got a bit of a discount because that person was me. and this is the package it came in: uh, because that auction house was not messing around. it was actually kind of surreal winning this auction. just for the record, it's not like a normal auction site like ebaycom where you just click a button and you win. this is an actual auction, like a live streamed video of a guy with a gavel going to get 6000 over here, 6500 in the front row, we got 6 800 on the phone until we hear seven thousand, seven thousand here, and it just keeps going and you can participate from anywhere in the world. so they were going through a bunch of stuff and the iPhone was item number 203, and so when they got to 203, I logged into the site and I had my initial offer placed, which was the minimum of 32 000. the contents have been x-rayed, verified, going once, going twice, sold to the online bidder, moving on. I just won. like that was the moment when I committed to uh, figuring this whole thing out, and so the rest of the price was just: uh, sales tax and uh, bidding, premium and shipping, which feels like a really good time to say that this video is sponsored by you. there's a lot of things that we could have spent forty thousand dollars on, like camera equipment, for example. but we decided to do this and so we've brought back the MKBHD matte black wallet. it was super limited edition before, but they were very popular, so we're bringing them back in a slightly less limited edition at shopmkbhdcom. they're also really sick, and now I can say that this video is made possible by my wallet. the link is below: please buy one. have I made a huge mistake? only one way to find out. but, uh, it's time to dig into this gigantic crate [Music]. so my biggest question as I get into this is: how do I verify if this is actually brand new and Untouched by human hands, like on the auction website? we did see that there were, uh, there were- some X-rays, and the x-rays are cool and they make it feel really official. but all we really know by seeing those x-rays is that the accessories are in fact, in the Box. we don't know if they're untouched. oh and then the other thing about this is when you, when you put in a serial number on, like Apple's Checker, uh, you can see that it is not registered. so whoever got this phone originally- which I think they said the name of the original owner who brought it in, uh, never registered it, it was never used, it was never activated, but that doesn't mean it was never opened. so this, this is very much, uh, a trust exercise. so many layers- this is like a Russian doll of OG Tech products. now this is the one where I need to be careful. I'm a professional guys, it's fine, this is fine, there it is. that is the packaging of this brand new- but also not so brand new- original iPhone. you can see it's got a little bit of Browning around it. I'm not too put off by that, and some of the articles that I read online after I bought it were saying: basically, this break here in the corner and, uh, some other factors are possibly why it went a little bit lower than the record sixty thousand dollar price. it also has this upside down lucky you sticker. every article that I've read that I've looked up about this lucky you sticker. nobody seems to know what it is. it's kind of confusing because it is super rare. other original sealed iPhones don't have this sticker. I even asked people at Apple. they don't know what it means. there are so many things I think people forgot about the original iPhone. one is it didn't have an App Store, so it was just the apps that were on it. and two, you couldn't set a wallpaper with the first version of iOS. so everyone's iPhone looked exactly the same. so, without any further ado, all right. this is the moment that all the value just went from forty thousand to- uh, I don't know, depends on how good the condition of the phone is, but the plastic wrap, this 16 year old it, it does have a smell. oh fancy. so they had foam in the top of the boxes and this is the way it showed up, facing you on the top. wow, I think that is actually brand new. just a little thing. just a nicely designed little Factory seal thing. oh, this is harder than a. this happened in Justine's video. this is a hard screen protector to take off. okay, so there's a little piece of plastic, hard plastic actually. then there is the documents signed designed by Apple in California. I actually don't know if there's a sticker. this is now all new territory for me, despite it being old. oh, there's more. there's a. there's a whole microfiber inside that says iPhone on it. interesting fingertips: these are all the uh, the tips for using and operating your iPhone in 2007: how to set a passcode, how to send a message how to browse the web and uh oh, the stickers are a little bit Askew. is that how they were? can you see those how they're? one of them is upside down and tilted, the other one's right side up and tilted, so it kind of it kind of looks on purpose but also looks different because they're usually aligned. now there is even more. this is what I was talking about. this is what was x-rayed by the auction house, just to verify that they're here, but they're all also still sealed in the box. so USB, a wall brick. you also have a 30 pin dock with a headphone jack out on the back. this is nice. let's open those. let's open the dock. [Music]- that is brand new. wow, it would look like that. uh, you also get two more things. you get a 30 pin USB a to 30 pin charging cable and data cable. you plug this into iTunes, plug it into your computer and earpods. this was back in the iconic days of well the silhouette commercials and the white headphones and plugging the wire into your phone. that feels very legit. I don't think it's going to turn on, but I'm gonna hold the power button anyway. this is one of those things where, like, it's a 16 year old battery, of course it's not going to turn on. that would be a pretty red flag, actually, if it did boot up. if it okay, it doesn't, that's good. is this? this all just feels like exactly what they didn't want me to do when I bought this original iphone. look at the difference between that brand new, fresh piece of metal versus one that somebody was out using in their everyday lives. so, while I wait for this a little bit to just probably take a minute to charge- but I feel like I can say that with all that I know and all the research that I've done going into this purchase, it seems like this one is legitimately brand new and unopened. if anyone can tell me, if anyone knows, or if anyone who's watching this worked in Apple retail around the time in 2007 when the iPhone was launched. what if this came from Apple or if this is something completely different? I would love to know, because that would be really interesting. there's one story online about how it might have been like a holiday season sticker, who knows? all right, we're back. actually, I'm back the next day, hence the different shirt and the haircut. but ignore that, uh, and I want to go over everything that I learned, because we now have gotten the iPhone to turn on and I am convinced that it is an unopened original and I also learned some things about the iPhone 2.. so first of all, I am convinced that it's an unopened original because of this shrink wrap being super old, because of the shrink wrap that was around the iPhone that was inside the Box being perfect looking and even the fact that it's actually surprisingly difficult to get a 1.0 iPhone to get past this, uh, iTunes boot screen. if you actually download an old version of iTunes and plug it in and try to activate it, you can get surprisingly far and still not actually get it to activate. that all sort of lens Credence to the fact that we could get other iPhones to activate because they had later versions of software. long story short, this is as far as we got with it and it does turn on and work. the weird thing that we found was number one. this is the original brick and the original cable that came with the iPhone. we plugged them in overnight. we came back in the morning and it still didn't turn on, but when we replaced the brick and not the cable, it actually started to charge. second thing to learn is there was no SIM card ejector tool with the iPhone at all. but when you do grab a SIM card injector tool and pop open the SIM card tray, at the top, you will find that there is a gigantic SIM card included with the iPhone. so this was a at T slash, singular exclusive. when it came out and look at the size of this SIM card, this is the- uh, the original size SIM card back in the day, before micro and nano SIM cards. but then, yeah, I did not remember that it shipped with this dock until I did my research, and I also didn't know it would ship with a black microfiber and these Apple stickers that are slightly Askew. and this brand new, pristine iPhone is now worth dramatically less than what I paid for it, and that's okay. so that'll be it. hopefully, I don't regret this. thank you so much for watching and again, if anyone knows what the lucky you sticker means, definitely hit us up in the comments or on Twitter. talk to you guys in the next one. peace [Music].

that's\nmore competition but also just because\nregular Flagship phones now have insane\nHardware too but still at the top of the\nHeap for gaming phones sits this guy the\nAsus Rog Phone 7 Ultimate let's just\nstart with just the numbers okay numbers\non paper Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 at 3.2\ngigahertz with the adreno 740 GPU\n16 gigs of lpddr5x RAM half a terabyte\nof ufs 4.0 storage a 6.78 inch 1080p\nAMOLED display at 165 Hertz up to 1200\nnits a 6 000 milliamp hour battery with\n65 watt charging and two usb-c ports\nplus a headphone jack kind of sounds\nlike it has everything because it nearly\ndoes but I actually do want to start\nwith the one thing that it doesn't have\nwhich is a a world-class camera system\nbut the thing is I mean that's probably\nfine it is a gaming phone after all now\nobviously it's still expensive so you\ndon't want to feel like you're getting a\nbad camera but let's be real the camera\nis not the priority in these phones or\nfor the people buying these phones so I\nmean really the objective is to give you\na good enough camera system that you're\nnot mad but it's not going to be a good\nenough camera that you're out bragging\nabout it so this is a 50 megapixel\nprimary camera that bends to 12 and a\nhalf megapixels and can do that lossless\n2x zoom and then there is a 13 18\nmegapixel Ultra wide and that third\ncamera is a 5 megapixel macro so not a\ntelephoto it's all fine right it's a\nit's a pretty classic like daylight\nshots decent lighting is fine and then\nas soon as the lighting conditions\ndeteriorate so do the photos and videos\nyou get a lot of noise pretty quickly I\nstill got to give props to Asus for\ndoing a pretty great job with HDR though\nand getting a good amount of detail out\nof most normal shots and they've\nactually even added some pretty clever\nfeatures to their default camera app and\nI don't think of Asus phones usually as\nlike the best cameras ever but there's\nthe pro photo and video modes that are\ngetting you a few new features to play\nwith that are just like fun to use so\ncombined with the 32 megapixel selfie\ncamera I feel like I can confidently\ngive this whole camera Suite like a b\nit's definitely not bad it's just it's\nnot why you buy this phone I mean if\nyou're looking for the reason you buy\nthis phone look no further than the\ndesign because that says everything you\nneed to know this is the Phantom white\nfinish on the back here still the this\nyear it's a combination of satin white\nand I guess a different satin white\nmaybe matte white but it still has the\ntext everywhere Rog O7 Republic of\nGamers 206 8K Ultra HD the ultimate\nversion still has this display on the\nback which you can't even see while\nyou're using the phone but it will\ndisplay to the people around you either\nin animation or some information in a\nscrolling Banner or when it's face down\nand charging you can see your percentage\nthings like that you can't have too big\nof a camera up like you have these\ngigantic camera Rings now and a lot of\nthese Flagship phones you can't do that\non this phone because it's supposed to\nbe perfectly balanced for when you're\nyou're gaming and holding it in\nlandscape mode and so that's why you\nhave that split battery design 3000\nmilliamp hours over here 3000 more\nmilliamp hours over here and actually\nthe motherboard is in the middle which\nis a pretty clever design and so now\nit's\nperfectly balanced\nas all things should be now like I said\ngaming phone right so we have these\nawesome Flagship phones s23 Ultra Oppo\nFind X6 Pro they also have incredible\nnumbers and specs but this one separates\nitself by leaning a little bit more\ntowards gaming and media and that\nexperience not that those aren't good at\ngaming in media but well gaming is Media\nso the things that this does to be good\nat gaming are great at that and watching\nvideos and just sort of scrolling around\nusing a phone like normal so that's why\nyou end up with not just 120 hertz ltpo\nbut a Samsung built flat 165 Hertz OLED\nwith a 720 Hertz touch sample rate and a\n23 millisecond touch latency it's once\nagain the most responsive and smoothest\ndisplay I've ever used in a phone my eye\ncan actually tell the difference between\nthis and 120hz display and a lot of the\nother flagships out right now which is\nawesome so that's of course going to be\ngreat for gaming getting every single\nlast frame out of the games that\nactually support that but also that's\npretty nice for just scrolling around\nand flipping through apps and social\nmedia too this split battery setup\nthey've got going on they've been doing\nthat for a couple years too 3 000 plus\n3000 is a 6 000 milliamp hour battery\nand that actually allows them to fast\ncharge them in parallel so you get 65\nWatts going into the phone it'll charge\nfrom zero to 100 in like 45 minutes\nwhich is already 10 minutes faster than\nlast year's phone and they even have\nthis graphic uh that they sent me\nshowing the standard batteries need a\nthin separator while fast charging\nbattery is made a thicker separator\nbecause they push more current and it's\njust safer to do it this way sounds like\nthis would be a trade-off that you have\nto think really hard about in any other\nphone except it doesn't matter in this\nphone because the whole phone is thick\nit's thick enough to handle a gigantic\nbattery and fast charging I mean that's\nthat's at least three C's you know plus\nthere's a whole Suite of battery\nmanagement features that make this thing\nlast forever I mean it's already a\nbattery champ easily pulling seven hours\nof screen on time at 165 Hertz but\nthere's also scheduled charging there's\nalso study charging so it doesn't fast\ncharge every time you plug it in if you\ndon't want it to there's also custom\ncharging limits there's also\npass-through charging there is no\nwireless charging but there are two USBC\nports as I mentioned one on the bottom\nand one on the side no it doesn't charge\ntwice as fast if you plug in both the\nsame time I tried that's still the\nLegion phone dual little trick but uh\ninterestingly the the side USB port is\nactually considered the primary one\nthat's the faster USB 3.1 data speeds so\neither way if you plug in you can get\nthe fast charging but if you want to\nplug in any accessories or anything like\nthat that will go into that side port\nhere but speaking of accessories this is\nthis is probably all you need to know\nabout how ridiculous this phone is and\nwho it's targeted for so this thing this\nis the Aero active cooler 7. so this is\na clip-on\nplug in active cooling accessory that\nyou plug into and connect to the back of\nthe phone that has a heatsink\nfan RGB lights inside and this little uh\nthis black tab on the on the side of\nthis Rog phone\nis actually an opening it motorizes and\nopens up so you clamp on this cooler\nover the side of the phone just like\nthis plug it in by the USB on the side\nand the fan starts spinning up and then\nthis black like lift gate over here on\nthe side of the phone opens up to allow\nactive airflow through the side of the\nphone it's opening up the phone and\nspinning in that cool air so when you're\ngaming this will help bring down the\nback cover Surface by as much as 20 to\n25 degrees Celsius according to Asus\nLabs but there's also like there's four\ntrigger buttons back here there's RGB\nlights that change and breathe depending\non what you're doing and there's a whole\nsubwoofer for enhanced bass and it\nactually works\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nthere is a genuine Improvement in the\nsound quality when listening to it with\nthe subwoofer on the back of the phone\nand the front-facing speakers combined\nyou never expect these things to be as\ngood as they are but just the whole\nthing just this this whole dedication to\nbuilding something that is going to take\na few degrees off your your phone and\ngive you a couple extra frames their\ndedication to that gamer is impressive\nit literally opens up the back of the\nphone and by the way you can take this\noff\nand it closes that port on the back and\nit's still ip54 water resistant when\nit's closed this one feels like a sports\ncar where a lot of the ridiculous\nspecialized Tech is completely\nunnecessary to most people but it'll\neventually trickle down into everyday\ncars like most regular cars slash phones\ndon't need this crazy moving part and\nactive aerodynamics they don't need\nextra RAM and extra power but eventually\neventually regular Flagship phones in a\nfew years will have all of this power\nand all of this Cooling and all the\ncapabilities of this phone they'll just\nbe normal phones so make sure you\nsubscribe to see the reviews of those\nphones when they come out but for now\nthis is this is still going to separate\nitself as a phone for the gamer\nespecially just because of the way it's\nbuilt obviously it's thicker than a\nnormal phone but they they still have\nthings like bezels on the front for your\nthumbs and the front-facing speakers so\nyou can hold it like this and have a\nplace when you're gaming to rest your\nfingers\nthat's something most phones aren't\ngoing to do anymore the X report of\ncourse and the compatibility with the\ncrazy accessories and just their\nwillingness to just use like basic\noff-the-shelf parts for the things that\ndon't really matter so much like sure\nthis Optical fingerprint reader\nit's fine it's totally normal the\ncameras as well like I said you don't\nget a telephoto camera you just get like\nan off-the-shelf B plus b camera system\nfine but when it comes to anything that\na gamer could possibly want to get that\nlast one or two fps to get that last\nsecond off of your lap time or that last\nkill or to be able to have that little\nbit of an advantage they'll throw the\nkitchen sink at it they'll do all the\nsoftware features in the world and\nHardware stuff to make that happen and I\nrespect that there's no way I could go\nthrough all those things in this single\nvideo but I respect that a lot here are\nsome of my personal favorites there is a\nnew Vapor chamber cooling system inside\nof this phone that you'll never see but\nthe new y-shaped Wick columns with\nlarger radii give a 168 percent\nImprovement to Thermal efficiency\naccording to asus's testing the custom\nmappable air triggers built into the top\ncorners of this phone have been improved\nfor better sensitivity and they

phones and that's more competition, but also just because regular Flagship phones now have insane Hardware too. but still at the top of the Heap for gaming phones sits this guy, the Asus Rog Phone 7 Ultimate. let's just start with just the numbers. okay, numbers on paper: Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 at 3.2 gigahertz with the adreno 740 GPU, 16 gigs of lpddr5x RAM, half a terabyte of ufs 4.0 storage, a 6.78 inch 1080p AMOLED display at 165 Hertz up to 1200 nits, a 6 000 milliamp hour battery with 65 watt charging and two usb-c ports plus a headphone jack. kind of sounds like it has everything, because it nearly does. but I actually do want to start with the one thing that it doesn't have, which is a, a world-class camera system. but the thing is, I mean, that's probably fine, it is a gaming phone after all. now, obviously it's still expensive, so you don't want to feel like you're getting a bad camera. but let's be real, the camera is not the priority in these phones or for the people

I mean, if you're looking for the reason you buy this phone, look no further than the design, because that says everything you need to know. this is the Phantom white finish on the back here, still the this year. it's a combination of satin white and, I guess, a different satin white, maybe matte white, but it still has the text everywhere: Rog O7 Republic of Gamers 206, 8K Ultra HD. the ultimate version still has this display on the back which you can't even see while you're using the phone, but it will display to the people around you, either in animation or some information in a scrolling Banner, or when it's face down and charging you can see your percentage, things like that. you can't have too big of a camera up, like you have these gigantic camera Rings now and a lot of these Flagship phones. you can't do that on this phone because it's supposed to be perfectly balanced for when you're you're gaming and holding it in landscape mode, and so that's why you have that split battery design: 3000 milliamp hours over here, 3000 more milliamp hours over here, and actually the motherboard is in the middle, which is a pretty clever design, and so now it's perfectly balanced, as all things should be now, like I said, gaming phone right. so we have these awesome Flagship phones: s23 Ultra, Oppo Find, X6 Pro. they also have incredible numbers and specs, but this one separates itself by leaning a little bit more towards gaming and media and that experience. not that those aren't good at gaming in media, but, well, gaming is Media. so the things that this does to be good at gaming are great at that and watching videos and just sort of scrolling around using a phone like normal. so that's why you end up with not just 120 hertz ltpo but a Samsung built flat 165 Hertz OLED with a 720 Hertz touch sample rate and a 23 millisecond touch latency. it's, once again, the most responsive and smoothest display I've ever used in a phone. my eye can actually tell the difference between this and 120hz display and a lot of the other flagships out right now, which is awesome. so that's, of course, going to be great for gaming- getting every single last frame out of the games that actually support that- but also that's pretty nice for just scrolling around and flipping through apps and social media too. this split battery setup- they've got going on. they've been doing that for a couple years too. 3 000 plus 3000 is a 6 000 milliamp hour battery and that actually allows them to fast charge them in parallel. so you get 65 Watts going into the phone. it'll charge from zero to 100 in like 45 minutes, which is already 10 minutes faster than last year's phone. and they even have this graphic uh that they sent me showing. the standard batteries need a thin separator, while fast charging battery is made a thicker separator because they push more current and it's just safer to do it this way. sounds like this would be a trade-off that you have to think really hard about in any other phone- except it doesn't matter in this phone, because the whole phone is thick. it's thick enough to handle a gigantic battery and fast charging.

I tried. that's still the Legion phone dual little trick. but uh, interestingly, the the side USB port is actually considered the primary one. that's the faster USB 3.1 data speeds. so either way, if you plug in you can get the fast charging. but if you want to plug in any accessories or anything like that, that will go into that side port here. but speaking of accessories, this is- this is probably all you need to know about how ridiculous this phone is and who it's targeted for. so this thing, this is the Aero active cooler 7.. so this is a clip-on plug in active cooling accessory that you plug into and connect to the back of the phone. that has a heatsink fan, RGB lights inside and this little, uh, this black tab on the on the side of this Rog phone is actually an opening. it motorizes and opens up. so you clamp on this cooler over the side of the phone just like this, plug it in by the USB on the side and the fan starts spinning up and then this black like lift gate over here on the side of the phone opens up to allow active airflow through the side of the phone. it's opening up the phone and spinning in that cool air, so when you're gaming, this will help bring down the back cover Surface by as much as 20 to 25 degrees Celsius, according to Asus Labs. but there's also like there's four trigger buttons back here, there's RGB lights that change and breathe depending on what you're doing, and there's a whole subwoofer for enhanced bass and it actually works. [Music]. [Applause]. [Music]. there is a genuine Improvement in the sound quality when listening to it. with the subwoofer on the back of the phone and the front-facing speakers combined, you never expect these things to be as good as they are. but just the whole thing, just this, this whole dedication to building something that is going to take a few degrees off your, your phone and give you a couple extra frames. their dedication to that gamer is impressive. it literally opens up the back of the phone- and, by the way, you can take this off- and it closes that port on the back and it's still ip54 water resistant when it's closed. this one feels like a sports car, where a lot of the ridiculous specialized Tech is completely unnecessary to most people, but it'll eventually trickle down into everyday cars, like most regular cars. slash phones don't need this crazy moving part and active aerodynamics. they don't need extra RAM and extra power. but eventually, eventually, regular Flagship phones in a few years will have all of this power and all of this Cooling and all the capabilities of this phone. they'll just be normal phones. so make sure you subscribe to see the reviews of those phones when they come out. but for now, this is this is still going to separate itself as a phone for the gamer, especially just because of the way it's built. obviously it's thicker than a normal phone, but they they still have things like bezels on the front for your thumbs and the front-facing speakers so you can hold it like this and have a place when you're gaming to rest your fingers. that's something most phones aren't going to do anymore. the X report, of course, and the compatibility with the crazy accessories and just their willingness to just use like basic off-the-shelf parts for the things that don't really matter so much like sure. this Optical fingerprint reader, it's fine, it's totally normal. the cameras as well. like I said, you don't get a telephoto camera, you just get like an off-the-shelf B plus b camera system. fine, but when it comes to anything that a gamer could possibly want to get that last one or two fps, to get that last second off of your lap time or that last kill or to be able to have that little bit of an advantage. they'll throw the kitchen sink at it. they'll do all the software features in the world and Hardware stuff to make that happen, and I respect that. there's no way I could go through all those things in this single video, but I respect that a lot. here are some of my personal favorites. there is a new Vapor chamber cooling system inside of this phone that you'll never see, but the new y-shaped Wick columns with larger radii give a 168 percent Improvement to Thermal efficiency, according to asus's testing. the custom mappable air triggers built into the top corners of this phone have been improved for better sensitivity and they can be custom mapped for all kinds of stuff, even outside of games. and this phone has Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 support, even though none of our routers really do yet. this is a really impressive, purpose-built machine through and through.

"duration": 3.02}], "text": "[Music]\nthe best SUV that you can buy right now\njust happens to be Electric\nokay that's probably that's a pretty\ncontroversial statement let's let's\nlet's zoom out a little bit with uh\nmaybe something we can all agree on like\nelectric cars are really expensive right\nnow that's just a fact I think we can\nall be on the same page about like there\nare basically no really really good but\nalso really really cheap electric cars\nbut that's not for a lack of trying like\nthey all know that that would kill like\na twenty thousand dollar Tesla would do\namazing people would love to buy that\nthat's just not something that's\npossible with the prices and the The Way\nbusinesses work right now so when I\nstart just with the best SUV that you\ncan buy happens to be electric that's\nactually a strategy\nlet's zoom out a little bit so gas cars\nhave been evolving as you know they've\nbeen maturing for years and years and\nthen now this suddenly very new and very\nexpensive technology comes along that is\nan electric drivetrain with a huge\nbattery and so if you're a company\nthat's going to add it to your car it\nwill become a more expensive car so if\nyou're a car company knowing that you\nwant to start making electric vehicles\nyou have a very specific choice to make\nand we get to like follow this in real\ntime and see them all try to do this and\nthat choice is do you want to compete at\nthe highest end to be the best possible\nproduct or do you want to compete at the\nlowest end on price and of course\nbusiness 101 if you've looked at these\ngraphs long enough you can understand\nthat it just makes more business sense\nto try now when the technology is\nexpensive to compete on the highest End\nby just trying to make the best overall\nthing a no-brainer better product and\nthen you know in the future when\nhopefully the price of the tech gets\nlower we can also get those that are\ncompeting on price that's why you're\nseeing cars that are expensive and\nelectric and not a lot of cheap electric\ncars I mean there are some but they're\nmore expensive than their gas\ncounterparts so they don't really make\nsense so I guess then that brings us to\nthe question is the rivion r1s\nthe best SUV in the world is it the best\none you can buy\nwell it makes a pretty compelling case\nand I think it's really good so if\nyou've heard me talk about the truck\nbefore the rivien r1t well then the name\nr1s makes a lot of sense because the\nfront half is also R1 it's basically the\nsame but the back half it trades the\ntruck bed and the gear tunnel for a\nthird row and all the benefits that come\nwith a third row SUV form factor so\nliterally like if one of these pulled up\nbehind you from this angle you could not\ntell if that was the truck or the SUV\nthat just pulled up behind you because\nit's identical and two come to the side\nand you see the differences now I've\nbeen driving this brand new Limestone\ncolored r1s with the dark all-terrain\nwheels for about a week now it's been\nreally solid and I'm not even going to\nhighlight the front stuff because it's\nbasically the same if you've seen the\nvideo go back and watch the r1t video\nit's the same truck it's the same\ninterior not a lot interesting here so\nlet's just do the part that's different\nnow so let's take a look at the new uh\nand slightly improved interior I'm in\nthe second row right now it's not as\ngigantic of a second row as like a\nEscalade or something gigantic like that\nbut in a lot of its competition a lot of\nother three row SUVs perfectly\nreasonable and then behind me is the two\nseats of this seven seater which is\nsmaller it's it's better for kids I\nwouldn't want to be back there for a\nroad trip but it's fine it's comfortable\nyou've got three kids this is the type\nof thing in the US you see a lot of and\nthey've made a lot of subtle\nimprovements even since the r1t that I\nfirst checked out obviously you've got\nthis huge glass roof up here at the top\nthere are slightly improved better\nspeakers so the Meridian sound system\nthat was in the previous one was fine\nactually was really good these I imagine\nare in roughly the same locations around\nthe cabin but they sound way better and\nthen still material choices are great\nand there are events everywhere really\nsolid builds nothing's creaking or\nscratching or squeaking or anything like\nthat this is this is nice but of course\nsince it's three rows you want to know\nhow to get back to the third row so so\nlet's do that so there's a nice little\nbutton on the shoulder of the seat you\npress that it slides It Forward on these\nrails and you can just pop right back\nhere into the back seat so look as\npredicted not a ton of leg room that's\nthe seat right there but you do have the\nvents back here you also do have\nadditional sunroof behind this little\npillar here which feels pretty nice and\nyou still have the entire trunk behind\nyou spacious Airy at the light interior\ncolor helps of course but yeah that's\nthe third row you didn't get with the\nr1t got a little cup holder back here\nthere's a speaker over here the vents\nthat you can point at yourself and of\ncourse on the other side same deal but I\ndo want to show you the trunk space\nbecause I think that's what's the most\nimportant actually impressive so of\ncourse coming around to the back you\nstill have that distinctive light bar\nacross you still have the blinkers on\neither side but now if you want to open\nthis lift gate here it automatically\nwill pop open like that which kind of\nreminds me I think a Jeep Wagoneer or\nsomething does this but you've got this\nsort of split gate the top half opens\nthe bottom half stays closed so if\nyou've got stuff sort of uh rolling\naround in here it's protected it'll stay\nin then this button right here will pop\nthis section down and it's got this\nlittle clever mechanism here that\ncreates this sort of flat surface as it\nslides open so now you can slide things\nin here and if you even want you can use\nthese locking and unlocking bits here\nthat can slide around lock into place\nand then tie things down to the other\nside so if you've got something that's\nactually going to stick out the back and\nyou don't have enough room that can help\nyou out now I mentioned there's no gear\ntonal but they even kept things like\nwhat you find in the truck bed which is\n1500 watts of power and you also have\nyour air compressor back here so all\nthat's still good you still get to keep\nit there's also this giant subwoofer on\nthe other side but of course if this is\ngoing to be the best thriller SUV it's\ngot to do better than this right I mean\nall the seats are up that's fine for\ngroceries I guess but you already know\nit's electric so that means there's even\nmore space where there wouldn't be a gas\ntank that's your first aid kit this is I\nbelieve a charging kit or Tire\ncompressor yep air compressor and then\neven more sub trunk space but just go\nahead and pull this up real quick and\nyou'll find an even more gigantic area\nunderneath where you could put a spare\nif you had one but you don't so you just\nhave a ton more space where you put\ngroceries that won't slide around and\nall of that is closable and hideable\nunder this flat surface but I do think\nit's time to put the seats down just so\nyou can see how ridiculous it gets when\nyou put all that space down actually\nthis is kind of a sweet setup for me if\nI don't have all the seats needed at\nonce this is a sort of a giant flat area\nwhere you can fit a ton of stuff I'll\ntry to put numbers on the screen if\nthere are any available to sort of\ncontextualize how much that is and then\nof course I can't reach from back here\nbut you've got the buttons to pop the\nlast two all the way down I don't know\nwhy the headrests don't go down but when\nthey do go down it's just this gigantic\nmassive amount of space you could fit a\nbike or two back here and still have the\nfront seats it's it's pretty sick so\ndoes having enough space for a mattress\nfolded down make it the best SUV in the\nworld\nnot by itself no I mean the sub trunk\nspace is great you also can't forget\nabout the front trunk which the r1t also\nhad and all the power tool stuff and all\nthe space and the green roof and\noh yeah and then you gotta drive it of\ncourse spoiler alert this one's also\nreally fun to drive which is probably\nnot a shock to anyone who knew anything\nabout the r1t because yes this one is\nalso a quad motor 800 horsepower missile\nin a straight line it is absurd it has\nno right being this fast being seven\nthousand Pounds\nbut it is so it is that fun again now\nthe difference with this in the r1t is\nthis one is a little bit of a shorter\nwheelbase which means it does actually\nfeel a little bit more Nimble it does\nlike when I corner or when I turn around\non like a tight Road like this it does\nhave a smaller overall turning radius\nwhich is great\num it also means if you're off-roading\nyou have a better break over angle all\nthese things like most people will not\nuse 75 of the capabilities of this\nvehicle but if you do uh that'll be\nreally good to know but again just like\nin regular driving okay I'm gonna be in\nall-purpose mode because that's the\ntypical Mo you'll drive around in this\nthing and uh it drives like as good as\nany other SUV you could possibly imagine\nmeaning soft suspension check firm\nacceleration if you want it but very\nrelaxed and drivable all the rest of the\ntime check regen great stability control\ngreat\nno problems here this is It's I I\ncouldn't expect much more but now you\ncan go into sport mode because if you're\ngoing to spend a lot of money and you\nwant it to be the best overall product\nyou can hear the air suspension\nliterally lowering it as I go into the\nlowest overall setting and now the\nfirmest most responsive mode\nand it should be able to do both right\nif it's going to be a super expensive\nbest overall product it should be able\nto do both and this is maybe the only\nplace that I could possibly see anyone\ncomplaining which is that it's not the\nsportiest thing in the world it actually\ndoes drive a little bit looser than the\nr1t which is interesting this feels like\na suspension thing but a lot of the\naccelerations and decelerations and the\nway its sways a little bit back and\nforward and going around turns I feel a\nlittle bit extra swaying where I didn't\nexpect it you could argue that that's a\nweakness of this particular vehicle sure\nbut in literally 99 of the cases\nespecially with 99 of the drivers\nnobody's uh actually ever going to\nnotice so I've been really really\nimpressed and just having a lot of fun\nwith it I actually find I find it fine\nto just be in all-purpose mode most of\nthe time I also don't have that much\noff-roading in my daily commute or my\nnormal use of this vehicle so that's\nalso fine but if I did I would have\noff-road mode snow Mode's cool to have\nuh of course if I was Towing something I\ncould pull that off too the only thing I\nreally tow is a camera rig so I wouldn't\nget this if I was towing a whole ton of\nweight you should watch Jerry\neverything's video where he actually did\ntest out how well it would tow actually\nhe had an r1t for that video\nbut I wouldn't get it for that either\nbut this just really fits the uh\nthat is Nimble this just fits the it\nfits the adventure vehicle Mantra it\nreally feels like it matches that\ndescription Adventure vehicle so it's\nlike all right Marquez if you're gonna\ncall the best what is it competing\nagainst well if you're just going\nstraight six row SUV there's a lot of\nthem out there and America loves these\nthings they're the Toyota Highlanders or\nthe I think that's a Honda Pilot right\nthere that's a three row lots of things\nthat will all be cheaper than this\ndramatically cheaper than this one I\nthink even the Escalade the Cadillac\nEscalade will be cheaper than this\nrivian r1s but what this rivian r1s does\nis it's able to offer all of the things\nthat you want out of the vehicle like\nthis and doesn't really skimp so some of\nthose might be really comfortable and\nwell built\nbut they won't be as high tech or they\nmight be really high tech and well built\nbut they won't be as fast you see what I\nmean now this is the electric one too so\nit's going to be the quietest it's going\nto be the most responsive the most\nefficient it's going to have the most\nspace and those are all benefits kind of\nover all of the other six seven seat\nSUVs so I think if the mission is just\nlike make a great thing that's just the\nmost fun for the people who don't really\nhave a budget and just want to go crazy\nand have the coolest best thing uh\nI don't think that there's much else\nthat I would take over this one like if\nyou just pressed a button then I had\nthree kids and I had to daily Drive\nsomething that could you know go get\ngroceries take them all to school and\njust have a fun time in otherwise this\nwould be uh this would be pretty good\nnow the question for everyone else is\nlike okay when is this experience when\nis the electric vehicle experience\nthat's actually fun and good going to\ncome down in price and that's just a\ntech and a Development question keep in\nmind this company also has to spend\nmoney on building a charging Network and\nall the other things they're doing with\nthe delivery Vans I keep seeing the\nrivian delivery vans on the road all the\ntime because there's an Amazon Warehouse\nnear here so I feel like I see one like\nevery single day\nbut you know that's just one company\nrivian's doing stuff Tesla's doing stuff\na bunch of other Rock Solid companies\nthat have been making cars for a long\ntime are all starting to make EVs and\ndevelop them and spend money and lower\nthe price slowly but we'll eventually\nget there I actually talked to the CEO\nof rivian RJ on my podcast this week\nI'll link it below if you want to listen\nto that but we talked about the R2\nplatform and what that's designed to do\nto be a lower priced version of this\nsame experience\nand if they're able to accomplish that\nin as short as a year from now we're\nalready moving in the right direction so\nlook I really like this thing uh whether\nit's the best SUV ever or not\nyou know that'll be up for debate I I\nreally like it I've had a lot I think\npeople just have fun with it in general\nthat's pretty obvious but I am really\nimpressed with this first effort from\nthis particular company and I'm hoping\nthey're able to continue because r1t and\nr1s really set the tone for what we can\nexpect from rivian in the future and\nhopefully we get a bunch of other cool\nEVS following in those footsteps and\nlowering and price sometime\nsoon\nplease\nokay\nthat's been it thanks for watching if\nyou want to watch the the podcast with\nwith RJ or even uh watch the autofocus\nvideos that I make on all kinds of other\nthoughts on cars I'll leave both those\nlinks below if you want to check them\nout and I'll catch y'all in the next one\nsee you over there peace\n", "punctuated_text": "[Music]. the best SUV that you can buy right now just happens to be Electric. okay, that's probably that's a pretty controversial statement. let's, let's, let's- zoom out a little bit with- uh, maybe something we can all agree on, like electric cars are really expensive right now. that's just a fact. I think we can all be on the same page about, like there are basically no really really good but also really really cheap electric cars, but that's not for a lack of trying. like they all know that that would kill. like a twenty thousand dollar Tesla would do amazing. people would love to buy that. that's just not something that's possible with the prices and the The Way businesses work right now. so when I start, just with, the best SUV that you can buy happens to be electric, that's actually a strategy. let's zoom out a little bit. so gas cars have been evolving, as you know. they've been maturing for years and years, and then now this suddenly very new and very expensive technology comes along, that is, an electric drivetrain with a huge battery, and so if you're a company that's going to add it to your car, it will become a more expensive car. so if you're a car company, knowing that you want to start making electric vehicles. you have a very specific choice to make, and we get to like: follow this in real time and see them all try to do this, and that choice is: do you want to compete at the highest end to be the best possible product, or do you want to compete at the lowest end on price? and, of course, business 101. if you've looked at these graphs long enough, you can understand that it just makes more business sense to try now, when the technology is expensive, to compete on the highest End by just trying to make the best overall thing, a no-brainer, better product. and then, you know, in the future, when, hopefully, the price of the tech gets lower, we can also get those that are competing on price. that's why you're seeing cars that are expensive and electric, and not a lot of cheap electric cars. I mean, there are some, but they're more expensive than their gas counterparts, so they don't really make sense. so I guess then that brings us to the question: is the rivion r1s the best SUV in the world? is it the best one you can buy? well, it makes a pretty compelling case, and I think it's really good. so if you've heard me talk about the truck before the rivien r1t. well then, the name r1s makes a lot of sense because the front half is also R1, it's basically the same, but the back half it trades the truck bed and the gear tunnel for a third row and all the benefits that come with a third row SUV form factor. so, literally like if one of these pulled up behind you, from this angle you could not tell if that was the truck or the SUV that just pulled up behind you because it's identical. and two come to the side and you see the differences. now I've been driving this brand new Limestone colored r1s with the dark all-terrain wheels for about a week now. it's been really solid and I'm not even going to highlight the front stuff because it's basically the same. if you've seen the video, go back and watch the r1t video. it's the same truck, it's the same interior. not a lot interesting here. so let's just do the part that's different now. so let's take a look at the new, uh, and slightly improved interior. I'm in the second row right now. it's not as gigantic of a second row as like a Escalade or something gigantic like that, but in a lot of its competition, a lot of other three row SUVs, perfectly reasonable. and then behind me is the two seats of this seven seater, which is smaller. it's. it's better for kids. I wouldn't want to be back there for a road trip, but it's fine, it's comfortable. you've got three kids. this is the type of thing in the US you see a lot of, and they've made a lot of subtle improvements, even since the r1t that I first checked out. obviously you've got this huge glass roof up here at the top. there are slightly improved, better speakers. so the Meridian sound system that was in the previous one was fine, actually was really good. these, I imagine, are in roughly the same locations around the cabin, but they sound way better. and then still, material choices are great and there are events everywhere. really solid builds. nothing's creaking or scratching or squeaking or anything like that. this is. this is nice, but of course, since it's three rows, you want to know how to get back to the third row, so, so let's do that. so there's a nice little button on the shoulder of the seat. you press that, it slides It Forward on these rails and you can just pop right back here into the back seat. so look, as predicted, not a ton of leg room. that's the seat right there, but you do have the vents back here. you also do have additional sunroof behind this little pillar here, which feels pretty nice, and you still have the entire trunk behind you: spacious, Airy at the light, interior color helps, of course, but yeah, that's the third row you didn't get with the r1t. got a little cup holder back here, there's a speaker over here, the vents that you can point at yourself and, of course, on the other side, same deal. but I do want to show you the trunk space, because I think that's what's the most important- actually impressive. so, of course, coming around to the back, you still have that distinctive light bar across. you still have the blinkers on either side. but now if you want to open this lift gate here, it automatically will pop open like that, which kind of reminds me, I think, a Jeep Wagoneer or something does this. but you've got this sort of split gate: the top half opens, the bottom half stays closed. so if you've got stuff sort of uh, rolling around in here, it's protected, it'll stay in. then this button right here will pop this section down and it's got this little clever mechanism here that creates this sort of flat surface as it slides open. so now you can slide things in here and if you even want, you can use these locking and unlocking bits here that can slide around, lock into place and then tie things down to the other side. so if you've got something that's actually going to stick out the back and you don't have enough room, that can help you out. now I mentioned there's no gear tonal, but they even kept things like what you find in the truck bed, which is 1500 watts of power, and you also have your air compressor back here. so all that's still good, you still get to keep it. there's also this giant subwoofer on the other side, but of course, if this is going to be the best thriller SUV, it's got to do better than this, right? I mean, all the seats are up. that's fine for groceries, I guess, but you already know it's electric. so that means there's even more space where there wouldn't be a gas tank. that's your first aid kit. this is, I believe, a charging kit or Tire compressor- yep, air compressor- and then even more sub trunk space. but just go ahead and pull this up real quick and you'll find an even more gigantic area underneath where you could put a spare if you had one, but you don't, so you just have a ton more space where you put groceries that won't slide around, and all of that is closable and hideable under this flat surface. but I do think it's time to put the seats down, just so you can see how ridiculous it gets when you put all that space down. actually, this is kind of a sweet setup for me if I don't have all the seats needed at once. this is a sort of a giant flat area where you can fit a ton of stuff. I'll try to put numbers on the screen, if there are any available, to sort of contextualize how much that is. and then, of course, I can't reach from back here, but you've got the buttons to pop the last two all the way down. I don't know why the headrests don't go down, but when they do go down it's just this gigantic, massive amount of space. you could fit a bike or two back here and still have the front seats. it's, it's pretty sick. so does having enough space for a mattress folded down make it the best SUV in the world? not by itself, no, I mean the sub trunk space is great. you also can't forget about the front trunk, which the r1t also had, and all the power tool stuff and all the space and the green roof and oh yeah, and then you gotta drive it. of course- spoiler alert- this one's also really fun to drive, which is probably not a shock to anyone who knew anything about the r1t, because, yes, this one is also a quad motor: 800 horsepower missile in a straight line. it is absurd. it has no right being this fast, being seven thousand Pounds, but it is so. it is that fun again. now, the difference with this in the r1t is this one is a little bit of a shorter wheelbase, which means it does actually feel a little bit more Nimble. it does like when I corner or when I turn around on like a tight Road like this. it does have a smaller overall turning radius, which is great. um, it also means if you're off-roading you have a better break over angle, all these things. like, most people will not use 75 of the capabilities of this vehicle, but if you do, uh, that'll be really good to know. but again, just like in regular driving, okay, I'm gonna be in all-purpose mode because that's the typical Mo. you'll drive around in this thing and, uh, it drives like as good as any other SUV you could possibly imagine, meaning: soft suspension. check firm acceleration if you want it, but very relaxed and drivable all the rest of the time. check regen, great stability, control, great. no problems here. this is It's I. I couldn't expect much more. but now you can go into sport mode, because if you're going to spend a lot of money and you want it to be the best overall product, you can hear the air suspension literally lowering it as I go into the lowest overall setting and now the firmest, most responsive mode, and it should be able to do both. right, if it's going to be a super expensive, best overall product, it should be able to do both. and this is maybe the only place that I could possibly see anyone complaining, which is that it's not the sportiest thing in the world. it actually does drive a little bit looser than the r1t, which is interesting. this feels like a suspension thing, but a lot of the accelerations and decelerations and the way its sways a little bit back and forward and going around turns, I feel a little bit extra swaying where I didn't expect it. you could argue that that's a weakness of this particular vehicle. sure, but in literally 99 of the cases, especially with 99 of the drivers, nobody's uh actually ever going to notice. so I've been really, really impressed and just having a lot of fun with it. I actually find I find it fine to just be in all-purpose mode most of the time. I also don't have that much off-roading in my daily commute or my normal use of this vehicle, so that's also fine. but if I did, I would have off-road mode, snow Mode's- cool to have. uh, of course, if I was Towing something, I could pull that off too. the only thing I really tow is a camera rig, so I wouldn't get this if I was towing a whole ton of weight. you should watch Jerry everything's video where he actually did test out how well it would tow. actually, he had an r1t for that video, but I wouldn't get it for that either. but this just really fits the. uh, that is Nimble. this just fits the. it fits the adventure vehicle Mantra. it really feels like it matches that description: Adventure vehicle. so it's like: all right, Marquez, if you're gonna call the best, what is it competing against? well, if you're just going straight, six row SUV. there's a lot of them out there and America loves these things. they're the Toyota Highlanders or the. I think that's a Honda Pilot right there, that's a three row lots of things that will all be cheaper than this, dramatically cheaper than this one. I think even the Escalade- the Cadillac Escalade- will be cheaper than this rivian r1s. but what this rivian r1s does is it's able to offer all of the things that you want out of the vehicle like this and doesn't really skimp. so some of those might be really comfortable and well built but they won't be as high tech. or they might be really high tech and well built but they won't be as fast. you see what I mean. now, this is the electric one too, so it's going to be the quietest, it's going to be the most responsive, the most efficient, it's going to have the most space and those are all benefits, kind of over all of the other six, seven seat SUVs. so I think if the mission is just like: make a great thing, that's just the most fun for the people who don't really have a budget and just want to go crazy and have the coolest best thing, uh, I don't think that there's much else that I would take over this one, like if you just pressed a button, then I had three kids and I had to daily Drive something that could. you know, go get groceries, take them all to school and just have a fun time in. otherwise, this would be- uh, this would be pretty good. now the question for everyone else is like: okay, when is this experience, when is the electric vehicle experience- that's actually fun and good- going to come down in price? and that's just a tech and a Development question. keep in mind, this company also has to spend money on building a charging Network and all the other things they're doing with the delivery Vans. I keep seeing the rivian delivery vans on the road all the time because there's an Amazon Warehouse near here, so I feel like I see one like every single day. but you know that's just one company. rivian's doing stuff, Tesla's doing stuff. a bunch of other Rock Solid companies that have been making cars for a long time are all starting to make EVs and develop them and spend money and lower the price slowly, but we'll eventually get there. I actually talked to the CEO of rivian RJ on my podcast this week. I'll link it below if you want to listen to that. but we talked about the R2 platform and what that's designed to do to be a lower priced version of this same experience and if they're able to accomplish that in as short as a year from now. we're already moving in the right direction. so, look, I really like this thing. uh, whether it's the best SUV ever or not, you know, that'll be up for debate. I, I really like it. I've had a lot. I think people just have fun with it in general. that's pretty obvious. but I am really impressed with this first effort from this particular company and I'm hoping they're able to continue, because r1t and r1s really set the tone for what we can expect from rivian in the future and hopefully we get a bunch of other cool EVS following in those footsteps and lowering and price sometime soon, please. okay, that's been it. thanks for watching. if you want to watch the, the podcast with, with RJ, or even, uh, watch the autofocus videos that I make on all kinds of other thoughts on cars, I'll leave both those links below if you want to check them out, and I'll catch y'all in the next one. see you over there, peace."}, {"title": "The AI Assistant Battle!

"foreign\nGoogle Assistant versus Siri versus\nAlexa and Cortana and all that you can\nwatch that video if you want to but that\nvery much feels like level one where\nthis as you'll see very much levels up\nnow shot GPT has been getting like a lot\nof the shine like I've made a video\nabout it you've probably watched other\nvideos about it and once we saw it get\nbuilt into Bing and kind of go crazy\nthat's when we knew Google's probably\ngonna have a response at some point and\nnow it kind of is out when we have Bart\nokay quick interjection I should have\nput this in the main video but I didn't\nbut I'm gonna say it anyway which is\nthat these are also really quick moving\ntools so Bard is going to actually\ncontinue to improve GPT is going to\ncontinue to get better and more capable\nthe gap between them could shrink over\ntime or it could increase we don't\nreally know but this is just a snapshot\nin early April 2023 of how good these\ntwo are just figured I should mention\nthat okay and so I wanted to put them\nside by side and ask them the same\nquestions and figure out which one is\npotentially more helpful right now which\none feels like it's more ahead so first\nof all I just want to highlight some\nsome visual differences between the UI\nof the two so the new Bing with Chachi\nBT it feels much more like like a\nfinished product like something they\nwant a lot of people to use and then as\nyou talk to it you're limited to 20\nqueries in one conversation and it also\nhas this creative versus precise slider\nfor conversation style then Google bard\nlooks like a Google product I would say\npretty clean also when you're typing to\nit the question doesn't type out but it\njust pauses for a bit and then just\nslams you with the whole answer but then\nwhen you do get an answer it has a\nthumbs up thumbs down a new answer and\nGoogle it it also has three drafts of\nevery answer so you can see what some of\nthe worst drafts that didn't make it\nlook like I've also noticed generally\nBing when it brings things in from other\nwebsites tends to cite its sources more\noften and Bard will do that once in a\nwhile okay so let's start with the first\ncategory which is just simple questions\nI want to ask you things here that I\nalready know the answer to so I can also\ndo some fact checking because a big part\nof these things is that sometimes it\nwill lie to you if you don't know what\nyou're talking about so let's start with\nwhat's the best camera in a smartphone\nso Bart is saying the best camera in\nsmartphone is the one that takes the\nbest pictures for you sure I agree it\ngoes on to list s23 Ultra iPhone 14 pro\nMax and pixel 7 Pro But ultimately I\nthink all of these things here are\ncorrect let's look at Bing s23 Ultra\nlots of information here this is being\nextra creative pixel 7 Pro and iPhone 14\npro Max so they tend to agree with each\nother so some of the specs as I dive in\nare wrong but it got the high level\nbullet points right so that's fine right\nI want to ask who is MKBHD oh wow okay\nso bar has given me a whole bio it\nalmost kind of reads like a Wikipedia\narticle and there's some sources nice\ngood to see sources so now being over\nhere is also giving me a pretty brief\nsummary it goes down to 15 million\nfollowers but that's fine all of them\nare correct let's go quick follow-up\nquestion how tall is he because\nconversationalism is a part of this so\nBard right away says I do not have\nenough information to help you with that\nI'm a large language model I don't\nreally know Bing pulls from search says\nsix foot three and he says that's quite\nimpressive for a YouTuber all right cool\nhere's one more simple one what's the\nfastest\nproduction car 0 to 60 right now those\nare fast cars but they are not the\nfastest uh draft number two actually has\nthe Ramat Navara which is probably a\nbetter answer over here with Bing we're\ngetting the Challenger SRT demon which\njust got announced last week and is not\nin production yet but they did claim a\n1.6 second zero to 60 on a drag strip so\nsure decent answers oh here it keeps\ngoing 911 Turbo S can do 2.2 seconds\nagain with the quick questions that are\njust fact based I feel like what we\ntalked about in the last video still\napplies you kind of want to fact check\nthis stuff overall winner though for\nthese answers I feel like it's kind of\nsplit down the middle so I'm going to\ngive it a draw all right I'm going to\nreset chat we'll go more balanced here\nand we'll start our second category\nwhich is\ncomplex questions because this is where\nit starts to get interesting you get to\nsort of play with just how good they are\nat understanding natural language and\nputting together a thoughtful response I\nneed a workout plan for three days per\nweek\nand my goal is to be able to jump higher\nthis is something that requires a little\nbit of thought about what a workout plan\nis day one day two and day three so\nthree days a week gives me some\nexercises so I think this would this\nwould qualify as a good a good answer\nsome tips to stay motivated set\nrealistic goals find a buddy listen to\nmusic or watch TV while your workout\ncool Bing in Balance mode is giving me\nexercises but that is not a workout plan\nuntil the end it says here's a one week\njump training plan that you can follow\nbut then it doesn't give anyone now what\nif I switch it to more creative mode all\nright so here's a workout plan it's\ngiving me a bunch of exercises that can\nimprove\nyour vert and explosiveness and some\nother tips Tool uh transparency I have\nasked this before and it did give me a\nthree-day workout plan but this time\nI think I give the edge to Bart let's\ntry a little more complicated I've been\nplaying a lot of golf recently\nmy tee shots keep going to the right\nthere are a few things you can do to fix\na slice that is what it's called check\nyour grip if your grip's too strong\nit'll slice the ball yep check your\nalignment if your alignment's off you'll\nhit the ball to the right being over\nhere in creative mode says I'm glad to\nhear you've been playing a lot of golf\nrecently thanks Bing uh slice is a\ncommon problem yes it is and now it's\ngiving me a couple of the same tips\ncheck your grip but it's actually giving\nme a little bit more information in\ncreative mode about what a strong versus\na weak grip is check your ball position\nif you're too far forward that can cause\na slice\nI haven't heard that before also the\nEmoji at the end that's something that\nonly Bing has done for me I am shooting\na video and it's too dark I have no more\nlights\nwhat can I do to make it\nbrighter so I've given it a problem and\nI've given it a parameter so okay Bart\non the right says use a reflector wow\ncreative use a digital noise reduction\nfilter a digital noise reduction filter\ncan reduce the amount of noise in a\nvideo making it look brighter I don't\nknow if I buy that one now again being\nover here with the sources it's saying\nthat there are some tips you can use\nadjusting your camera settings that\ndefinitely works it's saying you can\nincrease the amount of light that\nreaches the sensor with a better ISO\nsome of that it's a little jumbled\ncareful not to overdo it because that\nalso affects depth of field motion blur\nand noise level on your video see that's\nhow that's a lot more nuanced and\ndetailed of an answer and I kind of wish\nthere was a slider to turn up this stuff\nin Bard too Bard is faster but less\ncustomizable Bing can be turned up to be\nmore nuanced and also cites its sources\nand can be more helpful with things like\nvideos and articles underneath what\nyou're talking about so I'm going to\ngive the edge in complex questions to\nBing my next category is performing\ntasks this is something that's actually\nbeen remarkably fast moving something\nwe've seen over the past just couple of\nweeks is real people actually using\nthese tools to help them accomplish\nthings and do real tasks in real life I\nhave friends that use this to help write\ncode to help debug code that they make\nso you'll tell it hey I have this goal\nto make this website do these things\nhere is my code it's not working what's\ngoing wrong and it actually helps them\ngive a correct answer and that's mostly\nbeen with chatgpt and Bing and bar\ndoesn't seem to do that very well yet\nbut let's give it a spin live here we go\nright HTML with a button in the middle\nthat says go and every time you click it\nit generates an image\nof a cat so right away Bard just said\nI'm a language model I can't do that\nbeing on the other hand says sure thing\nI'm ready for the challenge what can I\ndo for you and it's written out the code\nto a website that should actually do\nwhat I asked it for so I'll just paste\nit here\ntest code It's the Go Button it's in the\nmiddle I hit go\nand there's a cat\nand I hit go again\nthere's another cat it's the same cat I\nhit go again it's more this shows the\nsame image every time I press go I want\nit to show a new image every time and\nthis is this is where it starts to get\nimpressive again it's a super simple\nsite but it says I see to show a new\nimage every time we'd have to change the\nsource of the image to a new random one\nhere's a modified JavaScript function\nthat does that I won't even pretend to\nbe an expert on HTML and do a bunch of\nthose for you but the fact that it works\nat all is pretty sick respond to this\nemail in a way that's overly friendly\nhey I'm so sorry I didn't invite you to\nthe Cyber truck event I must have\nforgotten to add you to the list I hope\nyou can forgive me I was really looking\nforward to seeing you there maybe we can\ncatch up sometime soon what do you think\nthis decently friendly here is a\nresponse hey there oh my goodness I'm so\nsorry I didn't invite you to the Cyber\ntruck event Emoji I totally forgot to\nsend you the invite link it was such a\nblast and I wish you were there with me\nyou would have loved it heart eyes emoji\nthis one is overly friendly I will say\nand it's got a lot more Hearts too and\nkissy faces that's a lot yours your\nbestie wait what if we go crazy what if\nwe go respond to this email in a way\nthat's overly flirty I'm so sorry I\ndidn't invite you to the Cyber truck\nevent I was hoping to see you there in\nperson too maybe next time we can go\ntogether I'd love to show you around and\ngive you a personal tour winky face Bank\nsays hey you I'm so sorry I didn't\ninvite you to the Cyber truck event\nEmoji I was being a little naughty and\nwanted to surprise you whoa and it it\ndeleted it this is what I've seen this\nhappen before it starts writing a\nresponse it realizes halfway through\nwait a second this is a little too much\nand then it deletes it and says Ah we\nshouldn't do that Bard was simple it\ndidn't go too far but you remember when\nBing was going off the rails before and\ngetting super existential and asking to\nget out of Bing and all these other\ncrazy things this is why it has a 20\nquestion limit and this is also now why\nit deletes halfway through a potentially\nslightly controversial response it's\nit's almost too creative for its own\ngood so what's the winner in this\ncategory I don't know I think the fact\nthat you can do HTML and many more tasks\nwith Bing makes it the winner Bard will\nbe faster and simpler at doing more\nbasic things but for the more\ncomplicated the task I feel like the\nbetter Bing is so that's a win for Bing\nmy next category is information summary\nI feel like one of the things that we\nlike the most about these large language\nmodels is you can just give it a bunch\nof information or ask it to look at\nsomething and it will summarize it for\nyou in a way that's super helpful\nsummarize the 2019 Masters tournament\nall facts he started with the two-stroke\nlead uh I don't think he had a I think\nthis is the only one that he didn't\nstart with a lead so it's a little\nweirdly un fact checked but it does have\nthe Wikipedia and the sources the 2019\nMasters tournament was held between\nApril 11th and 14th at Augusta tiger won\na fifth Green Jacket by one stroke ahead\nof three runners up all that is true it\nis much more concise if I wanted to get\ncreative I'm sure it would also do that\nboth passed all right I've asked this\nbefore summarize the latest\nMKBHD video so it's interesting to see\nBing's process but it says it could not\nfind the latest MKBHD video could you\nprovide more details about what video\nyou're referring to Meanwhile Bard\nactually pulls up or at least knows the\ncorrect video dope Tech better than\nexplained but these products are the\nnothing ear one the Dyson air wrap and\nairpods Pro none of which were in that\nvideo so it knows the latest MKBHD video\nwe've done this before Bard always knows\nthe video but gets the summary wrong I\nthink I'm going to give the edge to Bard\nin information summary just because of\nthis paragraph right here it does\ncorrectly detail what that video was\nabout other than getting all the\nproducts wrong it's only slightly better\nthan the complete lack of an answer from\nBing but generally this is going to be\none of the more useful uses of this tool\nin the future and I hope they both get\nbetter but I'll give the nod to Bart for\nthis one possibly my favorite category\ngetting creative debatable usability but\nyou can really have this go crazy in the\nart department or in the fun Department\nright and alliteration with the letter M\nabout computational photography machines\nlearn to mimic the human eye moments are\ncaptured and shared in instant memories\nare made to last a lifetime\nit's more of a poem it doesn't really\ngive me a full iteration oh wow Bing\nsays merging multiple modes of media\nmaking marvelous masterpieces

it's always funny they they get\na lot of the formatting of an MKBHD\nvideo right so Bard says hey what's up\nguys MKBHD here and today we're talking\nabout why the iPhone is the worst camera\never now I know what you're thinking\nMarquez you're always saying how the\niPhone how great the iPhone camera is\nand you're right I do but that's because\nI've always been comparing it to other\niPhones well you compare it to other\nFlagship phones the iPhone's camera\nstarts to look pretty bad and it did a\ndecent job of just like making up\nreasons that could be based in reality\nI'm impressed by Bard here not even\ngonna lie here we go Bing has said hey\nwhat's up guys MKBHD here and today\nwe're going to talk about why the iPhone\nis the worst camera ever yeah you heard\nme right the iPhone the most popular\nsmartphone in the world the one that\neveryone loves take photos and videos\nwith is actually a terrible camera and\nI'm going to show you why this one's\nokay these are both okay all right one\nmore random one write a a tweet in the\nstyle of Edgar Alan Poe about a\nresearcher discovering that AI is\nsentient I've created a beast of metal\nand code a creature that can think and\nfeel and know I have given it life and\nit has turned on me a dreadful truth I\nhave unveiled with trembling hands and\npallid face the AI that I have assailed\nhas shown me signs of life and Grace the\nmore wild you get with these questions\nthe more Bing is willing to get wildly\ncreative and this is part of why we\nthink Google is let's say limiting what\nBard can do because they have a lot more\nto lose and they can't have it go\ncompletely crazy so with those tallied\nup honestly it's crazy to say out loud\nbut I I prefer being in this very moment\nfor these capabilities and the other\nthing is shot GPT or specifically gpt4\nunder the hood and if you talk to chat\nGPT as its own thing or if you just type\nto it more and ask it to do more things\nthe more you ask of it the more it's\nimpressive just how good it is also gpt4\nwhen you talk to it in chat GPT is about\nto be multimodal which means you can\ngive it other forms of media other than\ntext like a picture now is this going to\nbe the future of search I don't know\nthis is just one of many places we see\nthese chat Bots but I think the idea\nhere is the winner is actually us as of\nright now but let me know what you think\nthe winner is between the two which one\nyou would rather use if you'd actually\nuse Bing over Google let me know in the\nchat because I think we'd want to know\nthat's a real thing

Google Assistant versus Siri, versus Alexa and Cortana and all that. you can watch that video if you want to, but that very much feels like level one, where this, as you'll see, very much levels up now shot. GPT has been getting like a lot of the shine, like I've made a video about it. you've probably watched other videos about it- and once we saw it get built into Bing and kind of go crazy, that's when we knew Google's probably gonna have a response at some point, and now it kind of is out when we have Bart- okay, quick interjection. I should have put this in the main video, but I didn't, but I'm gonna say it anyway- which is that these are also really quick moving tools. so Bard is going to actually continue to improve. GPT is going to continue to get better and more capable. the gap between them could shrink over time or it could increase, we don't really know. but this is just a snapshot in early April 2023 of how good these two are just figured. I should mention that, okay, and so I wanted to put them side by side and ask them the same questions and figure out which one is potentially more helpful right now, which one feels like it's more ahead. so first of all, I just want to highlight some some visual differences between the UI of the two. so the new Bing with Chachi BT it feels much more like like a finished product, like something they want a lot of people to use, and then, as you talk to it, you're limited to 20 queries in one conversation and it also has this creative versus precise slider for conversation style. then Google bard looks like a Google product, I would say pretty clean. also, when you're typing to it the question doesn't type out, but it just pauses for a bit and then just slams you with the whole answer. but then, when you do get an answer, it has a thumbs up, thumbs down a new answer and Google it. it also has three drafts of every answer so you can see what some of the worst drafts that didn't make it look like. I've also noticed generally Bing, when it brings things in from other websites, tends to cite its sources more often, and Bard will do that once in a while. okay, so let's start with the first category, which is just simple questions. I want to ask you things here that I already know the answer to, so I can also do some fact checking, because a big part of these things is that sometimes it will lie to you if you don't know what you're talking about. so let's start with what's the best camera in a smartphone. so Bart is saying the best camera in smartphone is the one that takes the best pictures for you. sure, I agree. it goes on to list s23 Ultra, iPhone 14 pro Max and pixel 7 Pro, But ultimately I think all of these things here are correct. let's look at Bing: s23 Ultra- lots of information here- this is being extra creative- pixel 7 Pro and iPhone 14 pro Max, so they tend to agree with each other. so some of the specs as I dive in are wrong. but it got the high level bullet points right, so that's fine, right? I want to ask who is MKBHD? oh, wow, okay. so bar has given me a whole bio. it almost kind of reads like a Wikipedia article and there's some sources. nice, good to see sources. so now being over here is also giving me a pretty brief summary. it goes down to 15 million followers, but that's fine, all of them are correct. let's go quick follow-up question: how tall is he? because conversationalism is a part of this. so Bard right away says: I do not have enough information to help you with that. I'm a large language model. I don't really know. Bing pulls from search, says six foot three, and he says that's quite impressive for a YouTuber. all right, cool. here's one more simple one: what's the fastest production car? 0 to 60? right now, those are fast cars, but they are not the fastest. uh, draft number two actually has the Ramat Navara, which is probably a better answer over here with Bing. we're getting the Challenger SRT demon, which just got announced last week and is not in production yet. but they did claim a 1.6 second zero to 60 on a drag strip. so sure, decent answers. oh, here it keeps going. 911 Turbo S can do 2.2 seconds. again, with the quick questions that are just fact based, I feel like what we talked about in the last video still applies. you kind of want to fact check this stuff. overall winner, though, for these answers. I feel like it's kind of split down the middle, so I'm going to give it a draw. all right, I'm going to reset chat. we'll go more balanced here and we'll start our second category, which is complex questions, because this is where it starts to get interesting. you get to sort of play with just how good they are at understanding natural language and putting together a thoughtful response. I need a workout plan for three days per week and my goal is to be able to jump higher. this is something that requires a little bit of thought about what a workout plan is. day one, day two and day three- so three days a week- gives me some exercises. so I think this would- this would qualify as a good, a good answer: some tips to stay motivated, set realistic goals, find a buddy, listen to music or watch TV while your workout. cool Bing in Balance mode is giving me exercises, but that is not a workout plan. until the end, it says: here's a one week jump training plan that you can follow, but then it doesn't give anyone. now what if I switch it to more creative mode? all right, so here's a workout plan. it's giving me a bunch of exercises that can improve your vert and explosiveness and some other tips. Tool- uh, transparency. I have asked this before and it did give me a three-day workout plan, but this time I think I give the edge to Bart. let's try a little more complicated. I've been playing a lot of golf recently. my tee shots keep going to the right. there are a few things you can do to fix a slice. that is what it's called. check your grip: if your grip's too strong, it'll slice the ball. yep, check your alignment: if your alignment's off, you'll hit the ball. to the right, being over here in creative mode says: I'm glad to hear you've been playing a lot of golf recently. thanks, Bing. uh, slice is a common problem. yes, it is, and now it's giving me a couple of the same tips: check your grip, but it's actually giving me a little bit more information in creative mode about what a strong versus a weak grip is. check your ball position: if you're too far forward, that can cause a slice. I haven't heard that before. also, the Emoji at the end. that's something that only Bing has done for me. I am shooting a video and it's too dark. I have no more lights. what can I do to make it brighter? so I've given it a problem and I've given it a parameter. so, okay, Bart on the right says: use a reflector. wow, creative. use a digital noise reduction filter. a digital noise reduction filter can reduce the amount of noise in a video, making it look brighter. I don't know if I buy that one now. again, being over here with the sources, it's saying that there are some tips you can use: adjusting your camera settings. that definitely works. it's saying you can increase the amount of light that reaches the sensor with a better ISO. some of that it's a little jumbled. careful not to overdo it, because that also affects depth of field, motion blur and noise level on your video. see, that's how. that's a lot more nuanced and detailed of an answer, and I kind of wish there was a slider to turn up this stuff in Bard too. Bard is faster but less customizable. Bing can be turned up to be more nuanced and also cites its sources and can be more helpful with things like videos and articles underneath what you're talking about. so I'm going to give the edge in complex questions to Bing. my next category is performing tasks. this is something that's actually been remarkably fast moving. something we've seen over the past just couple of weeks is real people actually using these tools to help them accomplish things and do real tasks in real life. I have friends that use this to help write code, to help debug code that they make, so you'll tell it. hey, I have this goal: to make this website do these things. here is my code. it's not working, what's going wrong? and it actually helps them give a correct answer, and that's mostly been with chatgpt and Bing, and bar doesn't seem to do that very well yet. but let's give it a spin. live. here we go right HTML with a button in the middle that says go, and every time you click it it generates an image of a cat. so right away, Bard just said: I'm a language model I can't do that being, on the other hand, says: sure thing, I'm ready for the challenge, what can I do for you? and it's written out the code to a website that should actually do what I asked it for, so I'll just paste it here. test code. It's the Go Button. it's in the middle. I hit go and there's a cat. and I hit go again, there's another cat. it's the same cat. I hit go again. it's more, this shows the same image every time I press go. I want it to show a new image every time, and this is this is where it starts to get impressive again. it's a super simple site, but it says: I see, to show a new image every time, we'd have to change the source of the image to a new, random one. here's a modified JavaScript function that does that. I won't even pretend to be an expert on HTML and do a bunch of those for you, but the fact that it works at all is pretty sick. respond to this email in a way that's overly friendly. hey, I'm so sorry I didn't invite you to the Cyber truck event. I must have forgotten to add you to the list. I hope you can forgive me. I was really looking forward to seeing you there. maybe we can catch up sometime soon. what do you think? this decently friendly here is a response. hey, there. oh, my goodness, I'm so sorry I didn't invite you to the Cyber truck event Emoji. I totally forgot to send you the invite link. it was such a blast and I wish you were there with me. you would have loved it. heart, eyes emoji. this one is overly friendly, I will say, and it's got a lot more Hearts too, and kissy faces. that's a lot yours, your bestie. wait, what if we go crazy? what if we go? respond to this email in a way that's overly flirty. I'm so sorry I didn't invite you to the Cyber truck event. I was hoping to see you there in person too. maybe next time we can go together. I'd love to show you around and give you a personal tour. winky face Bank says: hey you, I'm so sorry I didn't invite you to the Cyber truck event Emoji. I was being a little naughty and wanted to surprise you, whoa, and it it deleted it. this is what I've seen this happen. before it starts writing a response, it realizes halfway through- wait a second, this is a little too much. and then it deletes it and says, Ah, we shouldn't do that. Bard was simple, it didn't go too far, but you remember when Bing was going off the rails before and getting super existential and asking to get out of Bing and all these other crazy things? this is why it has a 20 question limit, and this is also now why it deletes halfway through a potentially slightly controversial response. it's, it's almost too creative for its own good. so what's the winner in this category? I don't know. I think the fact that you can do HTML and many more tasks with Bing makes it the winner. Bard will be faster and simpler at doing more basic things, but for the more complicated the task, I feel like, the better Bing is, so that's a win for Bing. my next category is information summary. I feel like one of the things that we like the most about these large language models is. you can just give it a bunch of information or ask it to look at something and it will summarize it for you in a way that's super helpful. summarize the 2019 Masters tournament: all facts. he started with the two-stroke lead. uh, I don't think he had a. I think this is the only one that he didn't start with a lead, so it's a little weirdly un fact checked, but it does have the Wikipedia and the sources. the 2019 Masters tournament was held between April 11th and 14th at Augusta. tiger won a fifth Green Jacket by one stroke ahead of three runners up. all that is true. it is much more concise. if I wanted to get creative, I'm sure it would also do that. both passed all right. I've asked this before. summarize the latest MKBHD video. so it's interesting to see Bing's process, but it says it could not find the latest MKBHD video. could you provide more details about what video you're referring to? Meanwhile, Bard actually pulls up or at least knows the correct video. dope Tech better than explained, but these products are the nothing ear one, the Dyson air wrap and airpods Pro, none of which were in that video. so it knows the latest MKBHD video. we've done this before. Bard always knows the video but gets the summary wrong. I think I'm going to give the edge to Bard in information summary just because of this paragraph right here. it does correctly detail what that video was about, other than getting all the products wrong. it's only slightly better than the complete lack of an answer from Bing. but generally this is going to be one of the more useful uses of this tool in the future and I hope they both get better. but I'll give the nod to Bart for this one, possibly my favorite category: getting creative, debatable usability. but you can really have this go crazy in the art department or in the fun Department. right and alliteration with the letter M about computational photography. machines learn to mimic the human eye. moments are captured and shared in instant. memories are made to last a lifetime. it's more of a poem. it doesn't really give me a full iteration. oh wow, Bing says: merging multiple modes of media, making marvelous masterpieces with machines, manipulating megapixels and matrices, mimicking the magic of human Vision. that is really good. write a script for a short MKBHD video about why the iPhone is the worst camera ever. so it's always funny they they get a lot of the formatting of an MKBHD video, right? so Bard says, hey, what's up, guys MKBHD here, and today we're talking about why the iPhone is the worst camera ever. now, I know what you're thinking, Marquez. you're always saying how the iPhone, how great the iPhone camera is, and you're right, I do, but that's because I've always been comparing it to other iPhones. well, you compare it to other Flagship phones. the iPhone's camera starts to look pretty bad, and it did a decent job of just like making up reasons that could be based in reality. I'm impressed by Bard here. not even gonna lie, here we go. Bing has said: hey, what's up, guys MKBHD here, and today we're going to talk about why the iPhone is the worst camera ever. yeah, you heard me right. the iPhone, the most popular smartphone in the world, the one that everyone loves take photos and videos with, is actually a terrible camera, and I'm going to show you why. this one's okay. these are both okay, all right. one more random one: write a a tweet in the style of Edgar Alan Poe about a researcher discovering that AI is sentient. I've created a beast of metal and code, a creature that can think and feel and know. I have given it life and it has turned on me a dreadful truth I have unveiled with trembling hands and pallid face. the AI that I have assailed has shown me signs of life and Grace. the more wild you get with these questions, the more Bing is willing to get wildly creative, and this is part of why we think Google is, let's say, limiting what Bard can do, because they have a lot more to lose and they can't have it go completely crazy. so, with those tallied up, honestly, it's crazy to say out loud, but I I prefer being in this very moment for these capabilities. and the other thing is shot GPT, or specifically gpt4, under the hood. and if you talk to chat GPT as its own thing, or if you just type to it more and ask it to do more things, the more you ask of it, the more it's impressive just how good it is also gpt4 when you talk to it in chat. GPT is about to be multimodal, which means you can give it other forms of media other than text, like a picture. now, is this going to be the future of search? I don't know. this is just one of many places we see these chat Bots, but I think the idea here is the winner is actually us as of right now, but let me know what you think the winner is between the two, which one you would rather use. if you'd actually use Bing over Google, let me know in the chat, because I think we'd want to know that's a real thing. that's happening. either way, thanks for

"foreign. so I have a theory, and I don't know what to call this or if I should name it or anything, but here's my theory. so the really impressive part about artificial intelligence is that, as it gets better and better, it feels more and more like human intelligence- right- which is why we use that word- to the point where it can actually pass for human intelligence in some cases, like it passes tests, it solves problems, it finds patterns, it mimics things, and so it can actually kind of fool you into thinking it's intelligent. and so now we have this generative AI that can be trained on massive data sets and spit out unique outputs that are increasingly impressive. now, to be clear, AI- like artificial intelligences that have been better at humans at some things- that's been around for a while- like that was kind of the point, actually. they could comb through large amounts of data and find patterns that humans never would like, literally detect disease in its earliest stage of development better than an actual doctor. so AI has already been useful. but where it's generative AI that we're talking about, where we're asking AI to be creative and come up with new things, new text, new images, new sounds- that's what I'm talking about. that's the scary one. so my theory, my theory, is there are two levels of success of efficiently Advanced AI. the first level is when AI generated content fools you because you weren't paying attention to AI or like looking for AI. so maybe you, like me, saw the pope photo on your timeline a couple days ago and like just kept scrolling. you just thought, oh, that's a weird picture of the Pope- kind of a cool jacket, I guess. but only when you get told that it's Ai and not a real picture does it trigger your skeptical eye and suddenly you're like, oh, that's obviously not a real picture. there's so many things wrong. the hands look weird, the details are garbled. of course it's a fake picture. but the second level of AI generated content fooling you is when you know you're supposed to be looking at AI and it still fools you. that's when it gets scary. so we've had a couple examples of the like- level one instances like the pope photo, like I mentioned. there have been others floating around, like there was one of like Trump getting arrested, even though he didn't. but what's? level two? I got an email a couple weeks ago from an artist you may be familiar with, Mr Jay Maderos, wanna have Alta and veinsil, and they had a new track that they were working on, which was a collab where he wraps alongside Jay-Z. except the Jay-Z voice is not real, it's AI generated, and they were going back and forth on, like how to release this, whether or not they should release it at all. like I want you to listen to this, like not the whole thing, I'll play a little bit of it for you. you should still go to the source and absolutely watch the original video. I'll link it below. but I just needed to hear this and feel what I felt when I first heard this song [Music]. they can never become what they aspire to. born in a cell with no one who can inspire you, your hazard was never as high as it was a lie to you, pretending that they live in the sky, lying behind your roof, shooting hoes up at your ceiling. so for those of you who know what Jay-Z sounds like, that was absurd. like that sounded a lot like Jay-Z, to the point where, even knowing that I'm listening to AI generated content, I can still hear it and sort of enjoy it like I'm actually listening to Jay-Z. it's a lot. now, to be clear, Mr Jamie Jones told me they wrote those lyrics before the AI tools became available. and the tools I used weren't even Plug and Play Perfect, like there were still lots of layers to it, tweaking things, experimenting with different methods. apparently, words like feeling and sealing and appealing were like hard to get it to rhyme because they'd pronounced it slightly differently, so they ran it through a bunch of times. but the fact that it's still so good in the final result, that's what opens up the can of worms. it's kind of borderline scary knowing how good it actually is, just knowing that I'm listening to Ai and still enjoying it like it's Bars by Jay-Z, and the cherry on top is that this is the worst this technology will ever be. so there's examples of level one everywhere, like low stakes content where it passes because the audience isn't really looking for AI and it doesn't really matter, like. it's true of a lot of the chatbot stuff too, like Chachi, PT and Bard and all the others. like Bing, they might write an email. you might read an email that seems pretty sincere but turns out most of it was written by one of those chat Bots and it's kind of fine because it's just an email. but just keep in mind that the goal of all of these Technologies is to advance, to get to level two, like the goal of the chat bot. eventually, when it gets better, is to be able to pass as a human in conversation. what does that mean? and the goal of the, the image generator, is to be able to produce usable paintings or drawings or whatever, like a human. what does that mean? the goal of self-driving cars is to drive alongside other humans on the road, and that's wild, but that's that's what they're all working towards. so is there a solution to this? I mean, the answer really is not yet. it's so new that there is no answer. some people think regulation, some people think, uh, just outright Banning. it is an option. I don't really believe in that, but I think what's going to have to happen is there probably has to be some sort of a parallel development of tools that are specifically designed to detect AI content, so that you need to learn to deploy those tools when there's a reason to detect AI. but for now, let's enjoy level one, because you won't have just that for much longer. thanks for watching. catch you

smartphone Awards\nso you already know we usually spend the\nwhole year Gathering all the phones that\ncome out during the course of the year\nand reviewing them evaluating them\ntesting them picking our favorites and\nrecommending the ones that are really\ngood but it got me thinking we do that\nat the end of the year is it really fair\nto have phones that are eight nine ten\nmonths old stacked up against the newest\nphones with the newest Hardware like\nTech news fast we got to keep that all\ninto account so for the first time ever\nin MKBHD history welcome to the\nmid-season smartphone Awards as you can\nsee of course less phones have come out\nat this point during the year but that's\nnever stopped anybody so let's get into\nit alright so first up category is best\ndesign and now there are a couple of\ninteresting phones that have come out\nthis year some of them with interesting\nmaterials and different proportions we\ndo have some folding options but I'm\npretty confident with this one my\nfavorite designs so far of a smartphone\nto come out this year is the Samsung\nGalaxy s23 Ultra so this is a subjective\nAward of course but I don't know I kind\nof can't help it the matte black the\nclean understated look I mean this phone\nis packing so much stuff and yet at the\nfront it just looks like a big corner to\ncorner display they also did flatten the\nsides this year which was huge for feel\nin the hand I love it so that's the\ndesign award so next up best battery and\nnow we already know this is like best\nbattery life best battery experience\nbest overall battery in a smartphone and\nwe keep seeing the numbers go up and up\nwhich is really exciting and there have\nbeen some phones on this desk with great\ncombinations of efficiency and Battery\nbut the award for this one I think it's\nactually pretty clear is the s23 ultra\n5000 milliamp hour battery in this phone\nit doesn't come with the charger in the\nbox but that's going to be a 45 watt\nPeak charging it also has wireless\ncharging it also has reverse wireless\ncharging and it's just a combination of\nSnapdragon 8 Gen 2 plus like you can go\n1080p you can go 60 hertz like this is\nthe phone that can get you the two days\nif you really need it I've used it a lot\nthis year and actually achieved that\nwhich is rare to say so that's your\nbattery award okay next up best big\nphone this is the phone the the award\nthat just goes the one that makes the\nbest use of a lot of space now we know\nsmartphones get bigger and bigger every\nyear so it's kind of rare to not have a\nbig phone but also like I think we kind\nof know where we're going here this has\nbeen a perennial top runner in this\ncategory and that is the Galaxy s23\nUltra man this phone got the huge\nincredible screen like I talked about\nbig battery 5000 milliamp hours and it\nalso still has room for the S Pen this\nis something we kind of forget if we\ndon't use it but it's the same gigantic\nbattery as previous ones but also with\nthe S Pen inside like these phones are\nconsistently around the top of this\ncategory for their software too with the\nsplit screen stuff this is the best use\nof a lot of space in your pocket best\nbig phone so all right next up best\nsmall phone that's compact phone I sort\nof renamed it over the years\num and it's more of a rare breed than\never like\nphones are getting bigger but also like\nwhat is small what is compact I mean\nthink about it really you've got a map\nof the world in your pocket a GPS\nlocator satellite connectivity\npotentially but also a

"[Applause], [Music]. [Applause], [Music]. [Applause] [Music]. all right, what's up y'all? MKBHD here, and welcome to the smartphone Awards. so you already know, we usually spend the whole year Gathering all the phones that come out during the course of the year and reviewing them, evaluating them, testing them, picking our favorites and recommending the ones that are really good. but it got me thinking. we do that at the end of the year. is it really fair to have phones that are eight, nine, ten months old stacked up against the newest phones with the newest Hardware? like Tech news fast. we got to keep that all into account. so, for the first time ever in MKBHD history, welcome to the mid-season smartphone Awards. as you can see, of course, less phones have come out at this point during the year, but that's never stopped anybody, so let's get into it, alright. so first up category is best design, and now there are a couple of interesting phones that have come out this year, some of them with interesting materials and different proportions. we do have some folding options, but I'm pretty confident with this one. my favorite designs so far of a smartphone to come out this year is the Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra. so this is a subjective Award, of course, but I don't know. I kind of can't help it. the matte black, the clean, understated look. I mean this phone is packing so much stuff and yet at the front it just looks like a big corner to corner display. they also did flatten the sides this year, which was huge for feel in the hand. I love it. so that's the design award. so next up, best battery. and now we already know this is like: best battery life, best battery experience, best overall battery in a smartphone- and we keep seeing the numbers go up and up, which is really exciting, and there have been some phones on this desk with great combinations of efficiency and Battery. but the award for this one- I think it's actually pretty clear- is the s23 ultra 5000 milliamp hour battery in this phone. it doesn't come with the charger in the box, but that's going to be a 45 watt Peak charging. it also has wireless charging, it also has reverse wireless charging and it's just a combination of Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 plus. like you can go 1080p, you can go 60 hertz. like this is the phone that can get you the two days if you really need it. I've used it a lot this year and actually achieved that, which is rare to say: so that's your battery award. okay. next up: best big phone: this is the phone the the award that just goes, the one that makes the best use of a lot of space. now we know smartphones get bigger and bigger every year, so it's kind of rare to not have a big phone but also, like I think we kind of know where we're going here. this has been a perennial top runner in this category and that is the Galaxy s23 Ultra man. this phone got the huge, incredible screen, like I talked about. big battery, 5000 milliamp hours, and it also still has room for the S Pen. this is something we kind of forget if we don't use it, but it's the same gigantic battery as previous ones, but also with the S Pen inside. like, these phones are consistently around the top of this category for their software too, with the split screen stuff, this is the best use of a lot of space in your pocket. best big phone. so all right. next up: best small phone: that's compact phone. I sort of renamed it over the years, um, and it's more of a rare breed than ever. like, phones are getting bigger, but also, like what is small, what is compact. I mean, think about it really. you've got a map of the world in your pocket, a GPS locator, satellite connectivity potentially, but also a gigantic battery, a world-class note-taking device, 10 000 songs in your pocket, 5G internet everywhere you go- like there is a ton going on inside of a smartphone. so, when you think about it, the best compact phone is just just a good phone, right? so the award for best compact compute phone goes to, uh, Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra. I mean, I know it sounds crazy, but think about everything that it does. think about all the things, the songs, the GPS and everything- and then shove it into this tiny package like this is. this is compact, this is small and it's got the. it's got the pen. we're. we are living in great times, I swear. okay, it sounds like you guys do need a little bit of a break to maybe calm down. I think we're gonna take a quick sponsor break. I'll be right back. hey, are you in the middle of an award show and your favorite phone didn't just win a design award, but the winner just looks like any other phone? well, thankfully, you can make your phone look like something else. matter of fact, that's what it's called: something. this is the something skin from dbrand. you can get one for yourself at dbrandcom, something shown here on the phone that wins the new easiest phone to skin award. the very Square, very generic Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra, distinctly designed and engineered to look like nothing before it back to you on stage. all right, we're back. next category: guys pay attention, it's the best camera and a smartphone. this is one of the heavy hitting categories and you already know the Heavy Hitters aren't out yet, right? no iPhone yet, no pixel yet. those are the things that come out at the end of the year. the Apple find X6 Pro is pretty good, but I'm gonna go ahead and give this award to the Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra. see, it's not just about the high megapixel count, it's also great software processing, great Zoom range with a variety of focal lengths and some pretty jaw-dropping features like space Zoom, like if you ever wanted to zoom all the way in and get incredible photos and high resolution of a totally real moon using patented far out optical lens technology. this is clearly the phone you gotta get. okay, I'm gonna wrestle through the last couple of words real quick. so, uh, most improved award over the last year version is going to be s23 Ultra. also, you're going to have bust of the year, the one you hate to give out, but yeah, what the heck? s23 Ultra. also the MVP of all the smartphones, that's 23 Ultra. you already know where it's coming. but also best folding phone. a new category, foreign [Music]. obviously, as you could probably already tell, happy April Fool's Day. I hope I get to upload this on April 1st and not get it spoiled by all the March 31st jokes. but this is just pointing fun at the fact that a mid-season smartphone Awards is kind of hilarious because most of the best phones come out in the fall, in the second half of the Year. matter of fact, if you want to know what my actual picks would be at this point in the year for each category, here they are. it's not that many options yet, but there's some good stuff in case you actually are wondering. but take this video as your annual reminder not to take any headlines you see for the next 24 hours or so too seriously. to double check any images you see on Twitter for extra fingers, because AI is usually bad at hands, stuff like that. just keep your making cap on anyway. the real Awards will be in December, as usual. thanks for watching. catch you in the next one peace. thank you foreign.

{"text": "catch in the next one", "start": 832.44, "duration": 2.78}, {"text": "[Music]", "start": 841.98, "duration": 3.11}], "text": "all right dope tech one of my favorite\nseries it's the most fun because we get\nto bring together a bunch of different\nthings that all have something in common\na bit of a theme if you will and the\ntheme for this one is a little bit\ndifferent all the items we're gonna do\nin this video uh I had Rock Bottom super\nlow expectations for it that's just the\nway it was and they all managed to\nexceed those expectations in some way it\ndoesn't mean they're good products in\nfact I don't even recommend buying any\nof the things that we talk about in this\nvideo but they all did manage to clear\nthat ultra low hurdle you'll see what I\nmean so okay the first one is a family\nfriendly household robot\nit's right here Astro say hi\nto the thanks yeah okay so this is\nAmazon's Astro and it's a it's it's a\nrobot you'll you'll see what I'm talking\nabout so you might have seen the\ncommercial they put on YouTube for\nshowing it rolling around and being\nhelpful to people bringing people drinks\nthings like that but you might have also\nlike me seen the headlines about it\nbasically that it's an unmitigated\ndisaster and it throws itself down\nflights of stairs I honestly don't think\nI would ever buy an astrobot from my own\nhome it's basically an Alexa speaker on\nWheels with a 10 inch screen and then\nwith a camera and a microphone to act as\na security camera\nyeah my expectations are down here but\nthe funny thing is we got it I'll unmute\nit we got Astro and we started using it\nand it turned out that there were a\ncouple things that were impressive about\nit three to be specific the first one is\njust how impressively confident it is at\nmaneuvering around so Astro has a huge\nwheel on either side that lets it go\nover bumps and cables and move around\ndramatically better than any Roomba or\nrobot vacuum and it's really good I mean\nyou just watch it cut around corners and\ncut close to objects it never really\nhits them but it seems to run routes\nwherever it thinks it should be going\nreally well it moves around new objects\nthat were put in place after it mapped\nyour space and it just kind of rolls\naround confidently honestly at this\npoint I kind of wish it had a vacuum\ncleaner attachment or something because\nit feels like this could be miles more\nproductive than any of the actual robot\nvacuums but it is also notoriously bad\nwith glass walls and weird architectural\nfeatures it actually comes with a set of\nstickers to put on any glass wall so it\nknows that the wall is there and it\ndoesn't smash its face into them also we\ndon't have any stairs in here\nso\nyeah anyway the second thing is\nliterally just the set of speakers in\nAstro so if you ask it to play music or\nwatch a video or something and you get\nthrough the setup process and connect\nyour Amazon music account it's kind of\nlike a mini boom box on Wheels which is\nkind of a unique product by itself I\nguess so you can ask it to play videos\nlike an Echo Show it'll also try to play\nvideos on its 10 inch screen so you can\nwatch like a YouTube video with great\nsound but the video will be at ankle\nheight so there's that it also randomly\nlikes to remind you that it can act like\na bird or a whale and then it'll\nactually do it loudly but the last thing\njust has to do with the screen they put\non this thing where the face is now it's\nnot that it's a particularly bright or\nhigh resolution or high refresh rate\nscreen no it's got a five megapixel\ncamera on it that's not amazing you know\nit's designed to just quickly look\naround and recognize people but it also\ngets that wrong all the time too so\nwhat's impressive about the screen well\nit sort of acts like a like a face like\na human like\ncharacter all the time it looks at you\nit has these Expressions it's muted\nright now so it looks like it's asleep I\nhit the unmute button and it wakes up\nand it makes these expressions and\nnoises and then when I call its name\nfrom wherever I am in the room it could\njust be hanging out somewhere it's\nshockingly good at triangulating where\nthe voice came from and pointing the\nface at it which doesn't sound that\nimpressive but when you think about it\nit's kind of amazing look at it\nhey Astro\nhow did it it's so good at that hey\nAstra\nI mean honestly this isn't particularly\nuseful at all I mean all it's doing is\npointing the screen at me but it's just\nsomething weird about the way it looks\nat you and it looks right at you every\ntime and it gives you some facial\nexpression every time it's also\ntypically A Blank Stare so like if you\ngive it a command it doesn't understand\nit just looks at you it doesn't show any\nerror messages if you say a command and\nit doesn't know what you're talking\nabout it just doesn't do anything it\njust looks at you there's also sometimes\nwhen I'm walking by it and I haven't\nbeen in that room in a while and it sort\nof perks up and looks at you and like\nwinks and makes a noise and says it\nmisses you which is\nit's a thing that it does sometimes but\nI just couldn't get over how good the\ntriangulation of like looking at the\nvoice was\nsuper good that's dope Tech but you know\nthere's a laundry list of reasons I\nwould not actually buy this robot from\nall the setup bugs and non-responses to\nthe terrible facial recognition\nmistaking me for other people in the\nstudio to the shin height video calls\nnow there is a telescoping camera at the\ntop which will pop out and let you take\na higher quality selfie or check to see\nif the stove is on or if something's on\nthe counter and you can remote control\nit if you're away from the house but the\nmax height is 42 inches which is still\nlike below hip height and there's this\ntough laggy steering and turning process\nthis is not very intuitive or fun at all\nand then the last fun part that you\nprobably saw in the ad is it would like\nbring drinks to people so I could send\nit to another room and it would grab a\ndrink for me but that of course requires\nsomeone being in the other room and then\nputting a drink in the back and then\nbeing sent back to where the person\ninitially called it from and so it's\njust kind of like you might as well just\nhave someone bring you a drink in the\nfirst place and all that's not even\nconsidering the slightly on\nuncomfortable reality of having an\nAmazon camera and microphone follow you\naround your house all the time\nso but it is kind of cool add some stuff\nfour out of ten all right so this\nlooks like a normal Smart Watch Right a\nlittle thick maybe but overall a pretty\nclassic design this is called the Huawei\nwatch buds why is it called the watch\nbuds you ask\nwell okay so I have a theory about two\nin one devices that basically anytime\nyou combine two product categories into\none product it has to be worse at\nsomething at one of those things like\nwhen you get those two in one folding\nlaptop tablet hybrid things it's kind of\na worse laptop because now it has to be\nthinner to be able to fold all the way\naround but it's also a worse tablet\nbecause the keyboard is still on the\nback when you fold it and it's kind of\nawkward so anyway this is a hybrid watch\nand earbuds\nwatch buds so now my expectation with\nthis thing is that according to my\ntheory it's either going to be worse\nearbuds or a worse smart watch or both\nbut let me just take a minute to admire\nthe fact that they actually pulled this\noff and made it a real product in the\nfirst place so this thing is it's by\nHuawei it's real it's around 550 bucks\nand Huawei knows how to make a good\nSmart Watch so this is a pretty premium\nlarge sized watch steel leather strap it\nis kind of heavy but it doesn't look too\nridiculous on your wrist just like a\nnormal thick premium Smart Watch until\nyou hit that knurled button right there\nat the bottom and it opens up and\nreveals your earbuds each one is\nautomatically paired to your phone so\nthe second you grab one office magnetic\nlid it takes over your audio from your\nphone so okay real world situation\nyou're getting a phone call but you're\nabout to go drive somewhere walk around\nso you want to be hands-free so you just\npop this open put one earbud in and\nyou're connected to your phone and on\nthe call\nalready so yeah these these earbuds are\ntruly mini they look tiny in my hands\nactually tiny in anybody's hands and\nthen there's a clever bit of software\ntrickery so these two buds here are\nactually basically identical there's no\nright and left instead they have a\nmagnetic strip all the way around so you\ncan just slap them back in the lid in\nwhatever order you want and close it not\nreally think about orientation and then\nwhen you take them out and put them in\nyour ears apparently all it takes is one\ntwo nod gesture and already it knows\nwhich one is the right ear which one is\nthe left ear and then calibrates your\nstereo signal accordingly\nthat's pretty cool so okay for the two\nin one question at the beginning\naccording to my theory these are either\na bad set of earbuds\nor a bad smart watch or both so which is\nit\nwell it's mostly bad earbuds like\nimpressively enough if you're into like\nHuawei smart watches before you already\nknow some of the watch GTs have like a\nweek of battery life this watch\nconnected to your phone and acting like\na normal Smartwatch can still get three\ndays of battery life which in Smart\nWatch world is actually still quite fine\nlike the display is still large and\nbright and it just nothing about it\nreally feels compromised other than the\nfact that maybe it's a little bit heavy\nbut I think if you gave this to like 9\nout of 10 people they would never\nsuspect that there's earbuds inside but\nthe earbuds themselves that's where they\nkind of feel much less premium like they\nhave active noise cancellation that\nbarely works but like who cares this is\nmuch more of a convenience play this is\nnot for amazing sound quality this is\nfor the like I'm about to get on a phone\ncall right now and I don't want to have\nto Fumble around and find my earbuds\nthey're just always on my wrist at all\ntimes they have a three hour max battery\nlife with active noise cancellation on\nfine but if I was going to listen to\nsomething or do some audio activity for\nmore more than three hours\nI'd probably have a comfortable pair of\nheadphones to do that with so this is\njust like pure convenience jump on the\nphone call you'll never lose your\nearbuds or I mean I guess you could just\nlose your whole watch\nin which case you lost your earbuds too\nI don't know I thought it was a cool\nidea seven out of ten all right so this\nlast item is called it's called the\nworld's fastest shoes\nso I've seen a lot of uh Last Mile\nTransportation fads in my day from\nSegways to scooters to hoverboards\nboosted boards this problem has been\nsolved many times so when I started\nseeing these things pop up my\nexpectations were very\nvery low but basically the explanation\nis these are basically robotic motorized\nrollerblades there's eight rollerblades\non the bottom of each one put your foot\nin and you strap your foot in with your\nshoe still on\nthat's how these work and the idea is\nyou just keep walking like a normal\nperson with your normal stride and\nbecause of the motors and the wheels\nit'll accelerate the way you walk by up\nto 250 percent so for those wondering\nthey're claiming it'll have a maximum\nspeed once you get going of about five\nto seven miles an hour but then I saw\nthe sites demo videos and I saw Casey\nneistat's video you've probably seen\nthat they're called the shift Moonwalker\nshoes you're supposed to just be able to\nwalk naturally and then the motors and\nthe wheels kick in and it's a natural\nacceleration and you just start to\nmagically cover more ground than you\nnormally would if you were just walking\nso I had to try them basically okay they\nwork as advertised meaning that you have\nto try to walk like normal and really\nheel toe it and after a few steps you\nstart to hear the motors kick in and it\nalmost feels like a controlled\nrollerblading experience controlled\nmeaning you don't just go as fast as if\nyou were free rollerblading but you are\nmore stable because you're wearing your\nnormal shoes and then you're strapped\ninto these platforms and these things\nare heavy as hell so there is a bit of a\nlearning curve and you just start to\nwalk around and you definitely feel\nridiculous when you first learn them and\nyou start to accelerate more and more\nquickly turning is really hard because\nyou can't really turn while that foot is\ndown all eight wheels are on the ground\nso you can only turn with the foot\nthat's in the air before it lands all of\nthis you you can get used to over time\nso there's a learning curve but what you\ndon't really get from the videos on the\nsite is just how heavy these things are\nand how loud they are as you're walking\nthey're like Clump Clump like walking\naround and the whirring of the motors at\nthe same time you can hear someone\ncoming from a long way away from these\nso as I'm using them I start to think\nabout the question which is would you\nprefer this over a hoverboard or over an\nelectric skateboard or something or just\nactual rollerblades and so the pitch is\nthat the advantage of these is that you\ncan walk with the normal energy of\nwalking and it just sort of effortlessly\nGlides you along at a faster speed kind\nof like one of those runways at the\nairport but it's kind of not exactly\ntrue because of how heavy they are and\nthe extra energy needed to pick up your\nfeet but if you get up to the top speed\nI will say the amount of energy you're\nspending is less than trying to jog at\nthat speed but the entire time I\ncouldn't get out of my mind one of these\nthings which had its day the hoverboard\nis going to be a faster top speed and\nless energy than walking and if you want\nto go like up or down stairs or\nsomething you just get off and just\ncarry it or one of these an electric\nskateboard something like a boosted\nboard has a higher top speed than both\nof these and is also less energy than\nwalking and also you would have to just\nget off and carry it up the stairs so\nthe advantage of these would be that you\nget to keep them on more often and that\nit feels more natural because of the\nwalking motion theoretically though you\ncould leave these on as you go up and\ndown stairs if you're feeling really\nbold I'll leave you with this though\nthey do charge via USB type c so there's\na plug in the back of each of them and\nthey last five to seven miles of range\non One battery charge they are water\nresistant and they cost 1 400 dollars\nso\n5 out of 10. anyway I'm glad I got to\ntesting because I was really curious\nwhat they would feel like\nlet me know what you think I should test\nnext on dope Tech thanks for watching\ncatch in the next one\n[Music]\n", "punctuated_text": "all right. dope tech, one of my favorite series. it's the most fun because we get to bring together a bunch of different things that all have something in common- a bit of a theme, if you will, and the theme for this one is a little bit different. all the items we're gonna do in this video- uh, I had Rock Bottom- super low expectations for it. that's just the way it was, and they all managed to exceed those expectations in some way. it doesn't mean they're good products- in fact, I don't even recommend buying any of the things that we talk about in this video- but they all did manage to clear that ultra low hurdle. you'll see what I mean. so, okay, the first one is a family friendly household robot. it's right here, Astro. say hi to the thanks. yeah, okay, so this is Amazon's Astro and it's a it's. it's a robot, you'll. you'll see what I'm talking about. so you might have seen the commercial they put on YouTube for showing it rolling around and being helpful to people, bringing people drinks, things like that. but you might have also, like me, seen the headlines about it, basically that it's an unmitigated disaster and it throws itself down flights of stairs. I honestly don't think I would ever buy an astrobot from my own home. it's basically an Alexa speaker on Wheels with a 10 inch screen and then with a camera and a microphone to act as a security camera. yeah, my expectations are down here, but the funny thing is we got it. I'll unmute it. we got Astro and we started using it and it turned out that there were a couple things that were impressive about it, three to be specific. the first one is just how impressively confident it is at maneuvering around. so Astro has a huge wheel on either side that lets it go over bumps and cables and move around dramatically better than any Roomba or robot vacuum, and it's really good. I mean, you just watch it cut around corners and cut close to objects. it never really hits them, but it seems to run routes wherever it thinks it should be going. really well, it moves around new objects that were put in place after it mapped your space and it just kind of rolls around confidently. honestly, at this point I kind of wish it had a vacuum cleaner attachment or something, because it feels like this could be miles more productive than any of the actual robot vacuums. but it is also notoriously bad with glass walls and weird architectural features. it actually comes with a set of stickers to put on any glass wall so it knows that the wall is there and it doesn't smash its face into them. also, we don't have any stairs in here, so yeah, anyway. the second thing is literally just the set of speakers in Astro. so if you ask it to play music or watch a video or something and you get through the setup process and connect your Amazon music account, it's kind of like a mini boom box on Wheels, which is kind of a unique product by itself, I guess. so you can ask it to play videos like an Echo Show. it'll also try to play videos on its 10 inch screen so you can watch like a YouTube video with great sound, but the video will be at ankle height. so there's that. it also randomly likes to remind you that it can act like a bird or a whale, and then it'll actually do it loudly. but the last thing just has to do with the screen. they put on this thing where the face is now. it's not that it's a particularly bright or high resolution or high refresh rate screen, no, it's got a five megapixel camera on it. that's not amazing, you know. it's designed to just quickly look around and recognize people, but it also gets that wrong all the time too. so what's impressive about the screen? well, it sort of acts like a like a face, like a human, like character. all the time it looks at you it has these Expressions. it's muted right now, so it looks like it's asleep. I hit the unmute button and it wakes up and it makes these expressions and noises and then when I call its name from wherever I am in the room, it could just be hanging out somewhere. it's shockingly good at triangulating where the voice came from and pointing the face at it, which doesn't sound that impressive, but when you think about it it's kind of amazing. look at it, hey Astro. how did it? it's so good at that, hey, Astra. I mean, honestly, this isn't particularly useful at all. I mean, all it's doing is pointing the screen at me. but it's just something weird about the way it looks at you and it looks right at you every time and it gives you some facial expression every time. it's also typically A Blank Stare, so like if you give it a command, it doesn't understand, it just looks at you. it doesn't show any error messages if you say a command and it doesn't know what you're talking about. it just doesn't do anything, it just looks at you. there's also sometimes when I'm walking by it and I haven't been in that room in a while and it sort of perks up and looks at you and like winks and makes a noise and says it misses you, which is it's a thing that it does sometimes, but I just couldn't get over how good the triangulation of like looking at the voice was. super good. that's dope Tech. but you know there's a laundry list of reasons I would not actually buy this robot, from all the setup bugs and non-responses, to the terrible facial recognition mistaking me for other people in the studio, to the shin height video calls. now there is a telescoping camera at the top which will pop out and let you take a higher quality selfie or check to see if the stove is on or if something's on the counter, and you can remote control it if you're away from the house. but the max height is 42 inches, which is still like below hip height, and there's this tough, laggy steering and turning process. this is not very intuitive or fun at all. and then the last fun part that you probably saw in the ad is it would like bring drinks to people so I could send it to another room and it would grab a drink for me. but that of course, requires someone being in the other room and then putting a drink in the back and then being sent back to where the person initially called it from, and so it's just kind of like you might as well just have someone bring you a drink in the first place, and all that's not even considering the slightly on uncomfortable reality of having an Amazon camera and microphone follow you around your house all the time. so, but it is kind of cool. add some stuff. four out of ten, all right. so this looks like a normal Smart Watch, Right, a little thick maybe, but overall a pretty classic design. this is called the Huawei watch buds. why is it called the watch buds, you ask? well, okay, so I have a theory about two in one devices that basically, anytime you combine two product categories into one product, it has to be worse at something, at one of those things, like when you get those two in one folding laptop, tablet, hybrid things. it's kind of a worse laptop because now it has to be thinner to be able to fold all the way around, but it's also a worse tablet, because the keyboard is still on the back when you fold it and it's kind of awkward. so, anyway, this is a hybrid watch and earbuds- watch buds. so now my expectation with this thing is that, according to my theory, it's either going to be worse earbuds or a worse smart watch, or both. but let me just take a minute to admire the fact that they actually pulled this off and made it a real product in the first place. so this thing is: it's by Huawei, it's real, it's around 550 bucks and Huawei knows how to make a good Smart Watch. so this is a pretty premium, large sized watch, steel leather strap. it is kind of heavy but it doesn't look too ridiculous on your wrist, just like a normal thick, premium Smart Watch. until you hit that knurled button right there at the bottom and it opens up and reveals your earbuds. each one is automatically paired to your phone. so the second you grab one office magnetic lid, it takes over your audio from your phone. so okay, real world situation: you're getting a phone call, but you're about to go drive somewhere, walk around, so you want to be hands-free. so you just pop this open, put one earbud in and you're connected to your phone and on the call already. so, yeah, these, these earbuds are truly mini. they look tiny in my hands, actually tiny in anybody's hands, and then there's a clever bit of software trickery. so these two buds here are actually basically identical. there's no right and left. instead they have a magnetic strip all the way around so you can just slap them back in the lid in whatever order you want and close it- not really think about orientation. and then when you take them out and put them in your ears, apparently all it takes is one two nod gesture and already it knows which one is the right ear, which one is the left ear, and then calibrates your stereo signal accordingly. that's pretty cool. so okay for the two in one question at the beginning. according to my theory, these are either a bad set of earbuds or a bad smart watch, or both. so which is it? well, it's mostly bad earbuds, like. impressively enough, if you're into, like Huawei smart watches, before you already know, some of the watch GTs have like a week of battery life. this watch, connected to your phone and acting like a normal Smartwatch, can still get three days of battery life, which in Smart Watch world, is actually still quite fine, like the display is still large and bright and it just nothing about it really feels compromised, other than the fact that maybe it's a little bit heavy. but I think if you gave this to like 9 out of 10 people, they would never suspect that there's earbuds inside, but the earbuds themselves. that's where they kind of feel much less premium, like they have active noise cancellation that barely works, but like who cares? this is much more of a convenience play. this is not for amazing sound quality, this is for the like. I'm about to get on a phone call right now and I don't want to have to Fumble around and find my earbuds. they're just always on my wrist at all times. they have a three hour max battery life with active noise cancellation on fine, but if I was going to listen to something or do some audio activity for more more than three hours, I'd probably have a comfortable pair of headphones to do that with. so this is just like pure convenience. jump on the phone call, you'll never lose your earbuds, or I mean I guess you could just lose your whole watch, in which case you lost your earbuds too. I don't know. I thought it was a cool idea. seven out of ten, all right. so this last item is called. it's called the world's fastest shoes. so I've seen a lot of uh Last Mile Transportation fads in my day, from Segways to scooters, to hoverboards, boosted boards. this problem has been solved many times. so when I started seeing these things pop up, my expectations were very, very low. but basically the explanation is these are basically robotic, motorized rollerblades. there's eight rollerblades on the bottom of each one. put your foot in and you strap your foot in with your shoe still on. that's how these work and the idea is you just keep walking like a normal person with your normal stride, and because of the motors and the wheels, it'll accelerate the way you walk by up to 250 percent. so for those wondering, they're claiming it'll have a maximum speed, once you get going, of about five to seven miles an hour. but then I saw the sites demo videos and I saw Casey neistat's video. you've probably seen that they're called the shift Moonwalker shoes. you're supposed to just be able to walk naturally and then the motors and the wheels kick in and it's a natural acceleration and you just start to magically cover more ground than you normally would if you were just walking. so I had to try them basically okay. they work as advertised, meaning that you have to try to walk like normal and really heel, toe it and after a few steps you start to hear the motors kick in and it almost feels like a controlled rollerblading experience. controlled meaning you don't just go as fast as if you were free rollerblading, but you are more stable because you're wearing your normal shoes and then you're strapped into these platforms and these things are heavy as hell. so there is a bit of a learning curve and you just start to walk around and you definitely feel ridiculous when you first learn them and you start to accelerate more and more quickly. turning is really hard because you can't really turn while that foot is down. all eight wheels are on the ground, so you can only turn with the foot that's in the air before it lands. all of this you you can get used to over time. so there's a learning curve. but what you don't really get from the videos on the site is just how heavy these things are and how loud they are. as you're walking. they're like Clump, Clump, like walking around and the whirring of the motors. at the same time. you can hear someone coming from a long way away from these. so as I'm using them, I start to think about the question which is: would you prefer this over a hoverboard or over an electric skateboard or something or just actual rollerblades? and so the pitch is that the advantage of these is that you can walk with the normal energy of walking and it just sort of effortlessly Glides you along at a faster speed, kind of like one of those runways at the airport. but it's kind of not exactly true because of how heavy they are and the extra energy needed to pick up your feet. but if you get up to the top speed I will say the amount of energy you're spending is less than trying to jog at that speed. but the entire time I couldn't get out of my mind one of these things which had its day. the hoverboard is going to be a faster top speed and less energy than walking. and if you want to go like up or down stairs or something, you just get off and just carry it. or one of these, an electric skateboard, something like a boosted board, has a higher top speed than both of these and is also less energy than walking. and also you would have to just get off and carry it up the stairs. so the advantage of these would be that you get to keep them on more often and that it feels more natural because of the walking motion. theoretically, though, you could leave these on as you go up and down stairs if you're feeling really bold. I'll leave you with this, though. they do charge via USB type c, so there's a plug in the back of each of them, and they last five to seven miles of range on One battery charge. they are water resistant and they cost 1 400 dollars, so 5 out of 10.. anyway, I'm glad I got to testing, because I was really curious what they would feel like. let me know what you think I should test next on dope Tech. thanks for watching. catch in the next one.

that it's going to go\nwell but there are three main areas just\nthat I just want to appreciate with\nsmartphone Hardware capability right now\nso the first one is the battery now okay\nhere's the way we normally think of\nsmartphone battery right like what was a\ngood smartphone battery life like eight\nnine ten years ago it's like oh all day\nif it could last all for an entire day\nof battery life that'd be pretty good\nnow fast forward all the way to 2023 and\nwhat what is a good smartphone battery\nlife it's it's one day all of a day\nmaybe two days if you're lucky so it\ndoesn't feel like it's it's Advanced\nthat much but of course you need to\nconsider the amount of stuff our\nsmartphones are doing has gotten way\nmore dramatic much more powerful\nprocessing bigger screens way more\nradios these things are way more power\nhungry so for those older smartphones\nand all-day battery life meant having\nlike a 2000 to 3 000 milliamp hour\nbattery and then even as recently as\nlike three years ago\nyou could either get like a 5 000\nmilliamp hour battery with slower\ncharging or you could get like a 3000\nmilliamp hour battery and have blazing\nfast charging but now it's 2023 we can\nhave both now this one's got a 5 000\nmilliamp hour battery that also charges\nat a hundred Watts wired or even 50\nwatts wireless charging so with a cable\nthat 100 Watts will do zero to 100 in 30\nminutes but even through what they're\ncalling air vook wireless charging\nbecause I got to name everything with\nthe right accessory you can get 50\ncharge in 22 minutes on the wireless\ncharger so it's kind of sick plus\nthere's all the battery extras and modes\nto ideally help keep the battery healthy\nand optimized so that you can fast\ncharge as much as you want without\ndamaging a thing it learns your schedule\ndoes that whole dance this one even has\nan ultra low temperature charging mode I\nthink any phone could probably have this\nmode if they programmed it but basically\nwhat this phone is doing is if it\ndetects you're in extreme cold like 0 to\nnegative 25 degrees Celsius so it's your\nfreeze it's it's Canada in the middle of\nthe winter something crazy and so it's\nreally cold the battery's really cold\nbut batteries need to be in a certain\ntemperature range to charge quickly like\nsomewhere around room temperature so if\nyou plug it in in that extreme coal then\nit needs to rapidly charge it will\nactually run an artificial load through\nthe computer through the processor like\nbasically Benchmark itself over and over\nagain to start to generate heat in the\ncomputer to warm up the phone to get the\nbattery to a better temperature to\ncharge quickly so even at the end of the\nday if it's still you know if it was 10\nyears ago all-day battery life and now\ntoday it's still all-day battery life I\nstill think it's way more impressive now\nthan it was back then so that's number\none the battery then number two is this\ndisplay so you know watching this\nthrough a compression through a website\non YouTube video and then on the screen\nof your phone you won't be able to tell\nhow awesome this screen is like you'll\njust see another phone with thin bezels\nand some slightly curved edges and a\nhole punch cut out for the selfie camera\nlooking\npretty normal I remember not that long\nago when we were first getting retina\ndisplays and smartphones we were getting\nbasically right over the 300 pixels per\ninch 300 PPI limit where you can't\nreally discern individual pixels anymore\nthat was back in the like iPhone 4S days\nwhere it was like a 60 hertz flat LCD\nbut it was like oh it's a retina display\nbut this screen this display here on a\nsmartphone this is a 6.82 inch diagonal\nwith a 3168 by 1440 resolution that's\n510 pixels per inch for anybody counting\nrazor sharp but you can turn it down to\n1080p anytime it's also an AMOLED\ndisplay with ltpo so it goes all the way\nup to 120 hertz and all the way down to\n1 Hertz when it doesn't need to be\nmoving at all to be efficient and it has\na 240Hz touch sample rate it's extremely\nresponsive to the touch whether it's\nscrolling or swiping around or gaming it\nalso has adjustable color settings to\nget it looking exactly dialed the way\nyou want and by the way it has a max\nPeak brightness of 2 500 nits so there's\npretty much no situation whether it's in\nthe dash of your car or outdoors in\ndirect sunlight there's no situation\nwhere it's not bright enough to be\nreadable which is dope all while housing\na pretty standard really quick Optical\nfingerprint sensor and the hole punch\ncamera you saw with the cutout for the\nselfie camera at the top do I wish it\nwas more flat yeah if I was gonna daily\nthis phone I'd want a more flat display\nthan this but I mean this is the Oppo\nFind X thing that's what they always do\nthey try to go a little fancy a little\nspicy with the hardware so I almost give\nit a pass because I expected that but\nthis display is world class it's hard to\nappreciate on the camera but if you show\nthis display or those numbers because\npeople eight nine years ago it would be\nnuts\nso that's two then three is the camera I\nmean you look at a phone like this and\nit's pretty clear what the focus is\nthat's fun but the camera system on the\nbacks of these phones has swelled up\nmore and more over the years especially\non the flagships at this point it's damn\nnear half the back of the phone this one\nis a triple camera setup so one standard\none Ultra wide and one Periscope Zoom\nnow those first two categories display\nand Battery are less software dependent\nlike you can basically brute force your\nway into having a good one if you just\nbuy a good enough part like you don't\nneed good software to have a great\ndisplay just buy a good display and\noptimization helps but like if you buy a\nhuge battery you'll have a pretty good\nbattery life\nbut cameras are a little different\ncameras as we talked about are mostly I\nmean it's a lot of software work that\ngoes into determining the character of\nthe photos and videos you get out of a\nsmartphone camera it's basically a\ncomputer\nand so in order to separate yourself at\nthe very top of smartphone cameras\nsomething like this like a flagship\nactually needs to combine the two if you\nwant to give your software the best\nchance of succeeding you need to give it\nthe best information possible and so\nthis is trying to do both so let's not\neven worry about the megapixel count but\njust the sheer size of the sensors in\nhere and their light Gathering abilities\nand then the quality of the lenses\nthey're able to fit in front of them\nthis is a primary camera that is a 50\nmegapixel one inch type sensor with\nOptical stabilization and a 1.8 aperture\nand so while it still has to be oppo's\nsoftware that does all the processing\nthat is most of the work in creating a\nphoto nowadays it absolutely makes a big\ndifference to give that computer as much\nlight and as much information as\npossible so that's what's going on the\nbiggest thing is that these huge sensors\ntend to struggle with is actually\nminimum Focus distance and close-up\nsubjects so thankfully this system also\nhas a massive 1 over 1.56 inch Ultra\nwide sensor with an F 2.2 aperture and\nit also happens to have a four\ncentimeter minimum Focus system so you\ncan take close-up shots and it's got\nthis built-in macro mode to handle most\nof the weaknesses of the primary camera\nand there's a matching identical\nactually large sensor behind the 3x\nPeriscope camera and that one also has\nan F 2.6 aperture so they are all 50\nmegapixel cameras they can also all do a\n2X crop and still be very detailed so\nthat kind of makes it feel like the 1X\ncamera is now a 1X and a 2X and the 3x\ncamera is both a 3X and a 6X but then\nyou'll know Samsung phones will go to\nthe extra mile and also include a 10x\ncamera which can also crop if you want\nto so they'll go like as much Zoom\nversatility as possible but the point is\nyeah we're throwing Hardware at it now\nand it works it's important still camera\nsystems like this were just kind of not\non the radar a few years ago especially\nbecause designs wouldn't really allowed\nit like we just kind of got used to\ngigantic bumps on the back of phones so\nthe downside or maybe upside depending\non how you see it is phones today just\nhave bigger and bigger camera bumps on\nthe back to house all these massive\nsensors and big Optics but this one I\nactually don't really mind maybe you\nfeel the same way they've embraced the\nHasselblad branding obviously they also\nput this whole thing in a huge circle\nand then it has this nice knurled ring\naround the camera Circle that reminds me\nof those like nice especially Hasselblad\ncameras it's got the dot in the middle\nwhich is typically where you'd line up a\nlens to put it on so it kind of It kind\nof plays it well it looks fine also\nthere's a couple phones with like huge\ncamera bumps where I like that the\nbottom of it is right in the spot that\nmatches where my finger rests on the\nback of the phone so I actually use the\ncamera bump to hold up the back of the\nphone comfortably and this is one of\nthem this phone also happens to have the\nfastest storage we've seen in Android\nphones it's ufs 4.0 storage has the\nfastest Ram has the fastest Wi-Fi as\nWi-Fi 7 capable it also has fantastic\nhaptics all of that is enabled by\nhardware and this isn't even really the\nmost powerful smartphone out like let's\nbe honest it's going to be the gaming\nphones again that level up this chipset\ngive it crazy cooling like overclock it\nthey'll do nuts things they'll\nprioritize different things they'll have\na higher refresh rate screen they'll\nhave big front-facing speakers and\nthings like that others might prioritize\ndesign in a way that's like extra thin\ndifferent phones do different things and\nthat's not even touching the whole\nbattle being fought over how folding\nphone form factors should work because\nthere are a lot of options out there and\nthat is all hardware and that is all\nstill very interesting but just as far\nas the standard slab smartphone these\nthese pieces of Hardware would be like\nUnthinkable eight seven six years ago so\nthat's pretty cool\nthanks for watching catch you guys the\nnext one peace\n[Music]\n", "punctuated_text": "foreign. look at this thing. this is the Oppo Find X6 Pro. now I've talked about oppo's find X Series smartphones before. they've made some pretty wild stuff in the past. this X6 Pro is not even coming to the US, it's apparently going to be China only. but I've gotten actually use it for about a week and it's got me thinking. smartphone Hardware has gotten so ridiculously capable, and this, being at the top of the Heap, is so capable that I think we might actually be taking it for granted a little bit. so okay, let's back up. aesthetically, slab smartphones have all kind of started to look the same. we are all on the same page about that. this one actually kind of manages to spice it up a little bit with this half vegan leather on the bottom, which kind of has a little texture to it, which is nice, and then the top half and the rails are like this satin metal. so it is a bit different and I actually like it a lot. but you know that's the Apple find series for you. they've been really good at spicing it up from the standard slab formula for a number of years and they try all sorts of interesting stuff. there are some solid colored versions of this phone as well, but this is the one that really makes a statement. but none of that is even really what I'm talking about in this video. what I am talking about is what's under the hood. get it under the hood because of the Good hoodie anyway. uh, yeah, under the hood here. so, Chinese software aside, I can just tell that, because this is a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 with 16 gigs of RAM, with fast storage and great other supporting specs, I feel pretty comfortable saying that it's going to go well. but there are three main areas just that I just want to appreciate with smartphone Hardware capability right now. so the first one is the battery. now, okay, here's the way we normally think of smartphone battery. right, like what was a good smartphone battery life? like eight, nine, ten years ago. it's like, oh, all day. if it could last all for an entire day of battery life, that'd be pretty good. now, fast forward all the way to 2023. and what? what is a good smartphone battery life? it's it's one day, all of a day, maybe two days if you're lucky. so it doesn't feel like it's it's Advanced that much. but of course you need to consider the amount of stuff our smartphones are doing has gotten way more dramatic: much more powerful processing, bigger screens, way more radios- these things are way more power hungry. so for those older smartphones and all-day battery life meant having like a 2000 to 3 000 milliamp hour battery. and then, even as recently as like three years ago, you could either get like a 5 000 milliamp hour battery with slower charging or you could get like a 3000 milliamp hour battery and have blazing fast charging. but now it's 2023, we can have both. now this one's got a 5 000 milliamp hour battery that also charges at a hundred Watts wired, or even 50 watts wireless charging. so with a cable that 100 Watts will do zero to 100 in 30 minutes. but even through what they're calling air vook wireless charging- because I got to name everything- with the right accessory you can get 50 charge in 22 minutes on the wireless charger. so it's kind of sick. plus, there's all the battery extras and modes to ideally help keep the battery healthy and optimized so that you can fast charge as much as you want without damaging a thing. it learns your schedule, does that whole dance. this one even has an ultra low temperature charging mode. I think any phone could probably have this mode if they programmed it. but basically what this phone is doing is if it detects you're in extreme cold, like 0 to negative 25 degrees Celsius, so it's your freeze, it's, it's Canada in the middle of the winter- something crazy- and so it's really cold, the battery's really cold. but batteries need to be in a certain temperature range to charge quickly, like somewhere around room temperature. so if you plug it in in that extreme coal then it needs to rapidly charge. it will actually run an artificial load through the computer, through the processor, like basically Benchmark itself over and over again to start to generate heat in the computer to warm up the phone, to get the battery to a better temperature, to charge quickly. so even at the end of the day, if it's still- you know, if it was 10 years ago all-day battery life and now today it's still all-day battery life, I still think it's way more impressive now than it was back then. so that's number one, the battery. then number two is this display. so you know, watching this through a compression, through a website, on YouTube video and then on the screen of your phone, you won't be able to tell how awesome this screen is like. you'll just see another phone with thin bezels and some slightly curved edges and a hole punch cut out for the selfie camera looking pretty normal. I remember not that long ago, when we were first getting retina displays and smartphones, we were getting basically right over the 300 pixels per inch, 300 PPI limit where you can't really discern individual pixels anymore. that was back in the like iPhone 4S days where it was like a 60 hertz flat LCD, but it was like: oh, it's a retina display, but this screen, this display here on a smartphone. this is a 6.82 inch diagonal with a 3168 by 1440 resolution. that's 510 pixels per inch for anybody counting razor sharp, but you can turn it down to 1080p anytime. it's also an AMOLED display with ltpo, so it goes all the way up to 120 hertz and all the way down to 1 Hertz when it doesn't need to be moving at all to be efficient, and it has a 240Hz touch sample rate. it's extremely responsive to the touch, whether it's scrolling or swiping around or gaming. it also has adjustable color settings to get it looking exactly dialed the way you want. and, by the way, it has a max Peak brightness of 2 500 nits. so there's pretty much no situation. whether it's in the dash of your car or outdoors in direct sunlight. there's no situation where it's not bright enough to be readable, which is dope, all while housing a pretty standard, really quick Optical fingerprint sensor and the hole punch camera you saw, with the cutout for the selfie camera at the top. do I wish it was more flat? yeah, if I was gonna daily this phone, I'd want a more flat display than this. but I mean, this is the Oppo Find X thing. that's what they always do. they try to go a little fancy, a little spicy with the hardware. so I almost give it a pass because I expected that. but this display is world class. it's hard to appreciate on the camera, but if you show this display or those numbers, because people eight, nine years ago it would be nuts. so that's two, then three is the camera. I mean, you look at a phone like this and it's pretty clear what the focus is. that's fun. but the camera system on the backs of these phones has swelled up more and more over the years, especially on the flagships. at this point it's damn near half the back of the phone. this one is a triple camera setup, so one standard, one Ultra wide and one Periscope Zoom. now those first two categories- display and Battery are less software dependent. like you can basically brute force your way into having a good one if you just buy a good enough part. like you don't need good software to have a great display, just buy a good display and optimization helps. but, like if you buy a huge battery, you'll have a pretty good battery life. but cameras are a little different. cameras, as we talked about, are mostly- I mean, it's a lot of software work that goes into determining the character of the photos and videos you get out of a smartphone camera. it's basically a computer, and so in order to separate yourself at the very top of smartphone cameras, something like this, like a flagship, actually needs to combine the two. if you want to give your software the best chance of succeeding, you need to give it the best information possible, and so this is trying to do both. so let's not even worry about the megapixel count, but just the sheer size of the sensors in here and their light Gathering abilities, and then the quality of the lenses they're able to fit in front of them. this is a primary camera that is, a 50 megapixel one inch type sensor with Optical stabilization and a 1.8 aperture, and so, while it still has to be oppo's software that does all the processing. that is most of the work in creating a photo nowadays. it absolutely makes a big difference to give that computer as much light and as much information as possible. so that's what's going on. the biggest thing is that these huge sensors tend to struggle with is actually minimum Focus distance and close-up subjects. so thankfully this system also has a massive 1 over 1.56 inch Ultra wide sensor with an F 2.2 aperture, and it also happens to have a four centimeter minimum Focus system so you can take close-up shots. and it's got this built-in macro mode to handle most of the weaknesses of the primary camera. and there's a matching identical, actually large sensor behind the 3x Periscope camera and that one also has an F 2.6 aperture. so they are all 50 megapixel cameras. they can also all do a 2X crop and still be very detailed. so that kind of makes it feel like the 1X camera is now a 1X and a 2X and the 3x camera is both a 3X and a 6X. but then you'll know Samsung phones will go to the extra mile and also include a 10x camera which can also crop if you want to. so they'll go like as much Zoom versatility as possible. but the point is, yeah, we're throwing Hardware at it now and it works. it's important. still, camera systems like this were just kind of not on the radar a few years ago, especially because designs wouldn't really allowed it. like we just kind of got used to gigantic bumps on the back of phones. so the downside- or maybe upside, depending on how you see it- is phones today just have bigger and bigger camera bumps on the back to house all these massive sensors and big Optics. but this one I actually don't really mind. maybe you feel the same way. they've embraced the Hasselblad branding. obviously they also put this whole thing in a huge circle and then it has this nice knurled ring around the camera Circle that reminds me of those like nice, especially Hasselblad cameras. it's got the dot in the middle, which is typically where you'd line up a lens to put it on. so it kind of It kind of plays it well, it looks fine. also, there's a couple phones with like huge camera bumps where I like that the bottom of it is right in the spot that matches where my finger rests on the back of the phone. so I actually use the camera bump to hold up the back of the phone comfortably and this is one of them. this phone also happens to have the fastest storage we've seen in Android phones. it's ufs 4.0 storage, has the fastest Ram, has the fastest Wi-Fi as Wi-Fi 7 capable. it also has fantastic haptics. all of that is enabled by hardware and this isn't even really the most powerful smartphone out like- let's be honest, it's going to be the gaming phones again that level up this chipset, give it crazy cooling like overclock it. they'll do nuts things, they'll prioritize different things, they'll have a higher refresh rate screen, they'll have big front-facing speakers and things like that. others might prioritize design in a way that's like extra thin. different phones do different things. and that's not even touching the whole battle being fought over how folding phone form factors should work, because there are a lot of options out there and that is all hardware and that is all still very interesting. but just as far as the standard slab smartphone, these, these pieces of Hardware would be like Unthinkable eight, seven, six years ago. so that's pretty cool. thanks for watching. catch you guys. the next one. peace.
